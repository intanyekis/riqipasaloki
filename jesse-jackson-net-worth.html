He is well known for his work in the civil rights movement and is the founder of Rainbow/PUSH, a civil rights organization. Jackson is also a shadow Senator for the United States.</p><h2><span id=Jesse_Jacksons_Family_Background>Jesse Jackson’s Family Background</span></h2><p>Jesse Louis Jackson Sr. was born in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1941. His mother was 16 and his biological father was her 33-year-old married neighbor. Jackson’s mother later married Charles Henry Jackson, who adopted Jesse and changed his surname. However, Jackson also maintained a relationship with his biological father and considers both men to be his fathers.</p><h2><span id=Jesse_Jacksons_Education_and_Activism>Jesse Jackson’s Education and Activism</span></h2><p>Jesse Jackson grew up under Jim Crow segregation laws and attended a racially segregated high school in Greenville. He excelled in academics and sports and earned a football scholarship to attend the University of Illinois, a predominantly white school. However, he transferred to North Carolina A&T, a historically black university, where he played quarterback, was elected student body president, and participated in civil rights protests against segregation.</p><p>After graduating with a degree in sociology, Jackson received a scholarship to study for a master’s degree at the Chicago Theological Seminary. However, he dropped out in 1966 to focus on the civil rights movement. In 2000, he was awarded a Master of Divinity Degree based on his previous coursework and life experience.</p><h2><span id=Jesse_Jacksons_Activism>Jesse Jackson’s Activism</span></h2><p>Jesse Jackson participated in the Greenville Eight sit-in at the white-only Greenville Public Library in 1960, which led to his arrest on charges of “disorderly conduct”. Later, he worked for Martin Luther King Jr. and was appointed to establish a frontline office for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in Chicago. He became the head of the Chicago branch of Operation Breadbasket in 1966 and was promoted to national director the following year. He eventually resigned from the SCLC to found Operation PUSH, an anti-racism and anti-military oriented organization. Through PUSH, Jackson carried out numerous projects for the Black community, including launching the PUSH-Excel program for motivating teens and children to succeed.</p><h2><span id=Jesse_Jacksons_Political_Career>Jesse Jackson’s Political Career</span></h2><p>In 1984 and 1988, Jesse Jackson launched Democratic presidential campaigns, becoming the second black person to pursue a nationwide presidential campaign as a Democrat. He campaigned on a highly liberal platform, advocating for cutting the Department of Defense budget, creating a single-payer healthcare system, ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment, providing free community college, supporting a Palestinian state, and re-prioritizing the War on Drugs.</p><p>While he did not win the presidential nomination, Jackson served as the “shadow senator” for the District of Columbia from 1991 to 1997, lobbying for statehood. He also backed Democratic candidates Bill Clinton and Barack Obama during their presidential campaigns, and endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.</p><h2><span id=Jesse_Jacksons_Career_as_a_TV_Host>Jesse Jackson’s Career as a TV Host</span></h2><p>Aside from his work in activism and politics, Jesse Jackson also hosted the show “Both Sides with Jesse Jackson” on CNN from 1992 to 2000.</p><p>The show featured debates and discussions on various political and social issues, with Jackson serving as the moderator.</p><p>During his time as a TV host, Jackson was known for his passionate and eloquent speeches, as well as his ability to bring people from different perspectives together to have meaningful conversations.</p><p>Overall, Jackson’s career as a TV host helped further his message of equality and justice, and solidified his reputation as a prominent public figure in the United States.</p><h2><span id=Family_and_Personal_Life>Family and Personal Life</span></h2><p>Jesse Jackson married Lavinia Brown in December 1962, and they have five children together: Santita, Jesse Jr., Jonathan Luther, Yusef DuBois, and Jacqueline Lavinia. In 2001, Jackson’s affair with staffer Karin Stanford was revealed, resulting in the birth of a daughter named Ashley. Jackson currently pays $4,000 a month in child support. In November 2017, Jackson was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC2xKyqnmWalrCsv86nZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjesse-jackson-net-worth.html&text=Jesse%20Jackson%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjesse-jackson-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjesse-jackson-net-worth.html&title=Jesse%20Jackson%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjesse-jackson-net-worth.html&title=Jesse%20Jackson%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjesse-jackson-net-worth.html&title=Jesse%20Jackson%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjesse-jackson-net-worth.html&description=Jesse%20Jackson%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./molly-ringwalds-quotes-about-her-iconic-80s-outfits.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Molly Ringwalds Quotes About Her Iconic 80s Outfits">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./donald-glover-hints-return-to-stand-up-comedy-1234854662.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Donald Glover Hints At Possible Return To Stand-Up Comedy">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
