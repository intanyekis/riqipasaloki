Even the setup didn't go smooth, and according to band member Dave Godowsky, Paul Shaffer immediately looked down at the group.</p><p>"I plugged in my guitar but no sound would come out of the amp, the production crew was scrambling. I looked up desperately and saw Paul Shaffer just staring at me, confused. In hindsight his confusion was probably less about my inability to turn on an amp and more about why the hell a Guns n’ Roses cover band was playing there."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Tom Cruise Came Across As A Completely Different Person During His First Ever Appearance With David Letterman</a></span></p><p>The performance wasn't any better as within seconds, CBS had issued a censor on the band for swearing.

It was all very forgettable, and the pay wasn't great either.</p><h2 id=mr-brownstone-made-700-for-their-performance-on-the-late-show>Mr. Brownstone Made $700 For Their Performance On The Late Show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/your-paragraph-text-2023-07-07t191301-260.png><p>The payment for their appearance came from the agency that booked them onto the show. The value, $700 split among the band... Of course, taking on such a gig isn't done for the money, but instead the exposure than can come from it. Looking back, <a href=#>Dave Godowsky revealed it did more harm than good towards the band's career</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"In that sense, we were without a doubt the worst band to ever play Letterman. Of the five cover bands who have ever graced that stage, we’re unequivocally the least impressive. If you’re going to be bad at something you might as well go all the way and be the absolute worst."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>David Letterman Clearly Held A Grudge After This Politician Lied And Canceled His Show For Katie Couric Instead</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, the experience didn't go as the band anticipated. However, it should be noted that the group was far from the only act to struggle during their performance on the Late Show. In fact, another rock band was bashed for their performance as well.</p><h2 id=mgmt-was-also-bashed-for-their-performance-on-the-late-show>MGMT Was Also Bashed For Their Performance On The Late Show</h2><p>Back in 2013, MGMT was anticipating their performance on the Late Show, taking to Twitter and hyping up the set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, according to Consequence, their new single at the time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Life Is A Lie turned out to be a major disappointment</a>.</p><p>The publication writes, "We more so have a problem with last night’s “performance;” thousands of bands would kill for such a spotlight in the weeks leading up to their new album’s release. What’d MGMT do? For three minutes, Wyngarden banged repeatedly on an oversized, novelty cowbell while his bandmates battled to see who could look most disinterested."</p><p>It seems like those on Twitter also agreed at the time, stating that the performance sucked the energy out of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Others had a different opinion, stating that the band was purposely teasing the audience.</p><p>"The worst part is that nobody in the audience realizes that the song is a joke," a fan writes on YouTube.</p><p>Fans would also state that the host himself David Letterman didn't seem to appreciate the performance either. In truth, we've seen Letterman uninterested in his guests quite a bit in the past. That includes his time alongside Marilyn Manson, with the host deciding to talk with Paul Shaffer instead during the end of the interview.</p><p>Letterman wasn't as harsh during this moment, but it seems like the fans were. Clearly, those online have different opinions as to what was the very worst off all time. But it would appear as though this was also high in the order.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikq2WSp7y4utKtpqedXam1pnnWqKmsrF2iwrS1wpqjZqiVp7Owvsyeqaxllauys3nOp2StoJViuaLAxGaqoaenoq6lsYyaZKWnp2LAorjAq7Bmnp%2BnerW0xKKpZpmgpbKivsCnmp5n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmr-brownstone-the-worst-musical-performers-ever-on-the-late-showmade-a-low-salary-for-their-appearance.html&text=The%20Worst%20Musical%20Performers%20Ever%20On%20The%20Late%20Show%20Made%20A%20Ridiculously%20Low%20Salary%20For%20Their%20Appearan&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmr-brownstone-the-worst-musical-performers-ever-on-the-late-showmade-a-low-salary-for-their-appearance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmr-brownstone-the-worst-musical-performers-ever-on-the-late-showmade-a-low-salary-for-their-appearance.html&title=The%20Worst%20Musical%20Performers%20Ever%20On%20The%20Late%20Show%20Made%20A%20Ridiculously%20Low%20Salary%20For%20Their%20Appearan" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmr-brownstone-the-worst-musical-performers-ever-on-the-late-showmade-a-low-salary-for-their-appearance.html&title=The%20Worst%20Musical%20Performers%20Ever%20On%20The%20Late%20Show%20Made%20A%20Ridiculously%20Low%20Salary%20For%20Their%20Appearan" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmr-brownstone-the-worst-musical-performers-ever-on-the-late-showmade-a-low-salary-for-their-appearance.html&title=The%20Worst%20Musical%20Performers%20Ever%20On%20The%20Late%20Show%20Made%20A%20Ridiculously%20Low%20Salary%20For%20Their%20Appearan" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmr-brownstone-the-worst-musical-performers-ever-on-the-late-showmade-a-low-salary-for-their-appearance.html&description=The%20Worst%20Musical%20Performers%20Ever%20On%20The%20Late%20Show%20Made%20A%20Ridiculously%20Low%20Salary%20For%20Their%20Appearan" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-tyler-barriss-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tyler Barriss Now: Where is the Swatter Today?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tati-westbrook-bio-wiki-age-husband-sisters-youtube-net-worth-james-charles-gamelifeguru-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tati Westbrook Bio, Wiki, Age, Husband, Sisters, Youtube, Net Worth, James Charles, GameLifeGuru">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
