At the time, Weber was married to Small, and they had a baby son, Sean.</p><p>Despite the complicated situation, Joel was absolutely taken by her. Joel and Weber soon engaged in an affair. When the liaison was discovered by Small, Weber left both her lovers behind and vanished for several weeks.</p><p>A 21-year-old Joel phoned Small to beg for his forgiveness and then overdosed. Small rushed to Joel's side and got there just in time. But just a few short weeks later, Joel tried again, this time drinking furniture polish. Another family member found him, and this time, Joel checked himself into a mental hospital, where he stayed for three weeks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After much thought, he decided to pursue a relationship with Weber, who also agreed to manage him. They married in September 1973. “She’s Got a Way” and “She’s Always a Woman” were inspired by her. As his wife, Weber was entitled to 50 percent of Joel’s worth and was also taking a cut of his earnings as manager. She brought her brother, Frank, to manage her new husband's finances.</p><p><strong>In 1982, Weber filed for divorce and Joel was devastated.

Trying to find solace in his music, he found a piano bar and began playing. A few moments later, supermodels Elle Macpherson, then just 19, and Christie Brinkley, 28, walked in. The catwalk queens arrived alongside a then-undiscovered Whitney Houston. Out of the three beautiful women there that night, Joel fell in love with Brinkley.
