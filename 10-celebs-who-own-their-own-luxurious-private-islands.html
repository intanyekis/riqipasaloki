Whether you want to spend your hard-earned vacation days backpacking around Europe or experiencing an entirely new culture, the occasional vacation is much needed and usually much deserved. Wherever you choose to spend your time off, there is just something about a beach vacation that spells relaxation. Getting away from everyday life to relax on a beach somewhere and forget about all your troubles is always a good idea. There is nothing better than soaking up the sun and wading in the waves while sipping on a cool and refreshing beverage. What makes the image of sitting on a beach with your toes in the sand even better, is if you happen to be enjoying your vacation on your own private island. For the celebrities listed below, the dream of jetting away to a vacation filled with total and complete privacy is a reality. All of the celebrities listed below have each shelled out some big bucks in order to purchase their own private getaways. Some of these celebrities have opened up their islands to other famous friends, others choose to vacation on their own, and one celebrity received her private island as a gift from a former lover. So to make your future vacation plans feel sub par, below is a list of ten celebrities that own their own luxurious private islands. Let us hope that somehow, someway, we score an invite to one of these fabulous celebrity getaways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-eddie-murphy><strong>10. Eddie Murphy&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a title="Eddie Murphy Net Worth" href=#>Eddie Murphy</a> is not a newcomer to the business of buying private islands. The actor was the previous owner of a Bahamian Cay called Pearl, which is located right next to Paradise Island. After Murphy sold Pearl Island, the actor purchased Rooster Cay in 2007. The actor reportedly purchased the <a href=#>luxurious island</a> at a cool $15 million (Private Islands Magazine). Murphy’s new island is 15 acres and is nearby Nassau. Although it is unclear whether Murphy plans to turn the island into a resort, the island is reportedly the perfect place for a profitable business.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-nicolas-cage><strong>9. Nicolas Cage&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>According to the Hollywood Reporter, <a title="Nicolas Cage Net Worth" href=#>Nicolas Cage</a> is the former owner of Leaf Cay, an Exumas Island. Apparently, the actor was planning on developing the island but was banned from doing so because his island contained an endangered Iguana species. The actor purchased the island in 2006. According to Private Islands Magazine, the island is located around Nassau next to another private island that is owned by none other than Johnny Depp. Cage purchased the island for $3 million but managed to put it on the market at $7 million. Today, Nicolas Cage is pretty close to going broke so we're thinking that he won’t be buying any more private islands anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-mel-gibson><strong>8. Mel Gibson&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a title="Mel Gibson Net Worth" href=#>Mel Gibson</a> reportedly purchased Mago Island in 2005, for a whopping $15 million. The island, which is located in Fiji, is one of the largest in the South Pacific at 5,400 Acres. While some celebrities choose to turn their islands into a profitable business by turning them into private resorts, Gibson has chosen to do the exact opposite with his beloved private island. The actor has reportedly kept his Island as close to the way he bought it as possible, so that it has a more natural feel. In fact, the actor only employs a few caretakers to look after the island while he is away.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-tyler-perry><strong>7. Tyler Perry&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a title="Tyler Perry Net Worth" href=#>Tyler Perry</a> reportedly purchased White Bay Cay in 2009. The luxurious island is 25 acres and is located in the Bahamas. Unlike Gibson, Perry has chosen to build a home and guest bungalow on the island. Perry is also planning to build a spa, a tennis court and a marina. Even though Perry seems to be taking luxury to the extreme with his private island purchase, this isn't Perry’s first time in the private island business;&nbsp;White Bay Cay is actually Perry’s second island. It looks like Perry just couldn't get enough of the lifestyle that comes along with owning your own island.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-david-copperfield><strong>6. David Copperfield&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a title="David Copperfield Net Worth" href=#>David Copperfield</a> is basically the king of owning private islands. The star owns a whopping four private islands in the Bahamas for which he shelled out a cool $50 million. However, Musha Cay is the only <a href=#>private island</a> that is owned by Copperfield that serves as a resort. According to Forbes.com, it costs $37,000 a night (with a minimum of a four night stay) to spend your vacation at Copperfield’s private island. The island boasts a movie theater, five villas, and an on call staff at all times. The island also has some pretty interesting things you can order, like your own firework show.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-pamela-anderson><strong>5. Pamela Anderson&nbsp;</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most guys get girls flowers when they want to win them over, but apparently that is just not rocker <a title="Tommy Lee Net Worth" href=#>Tommy Lee’s</a> style. The musician bought his ex-wife, <a title="Pamela Anderson Net Worth" href=#>Pamela Anderson</a>&nbsp;an island in Dubai in order to win her over. Apparently Anderson was planning on turning the island into a resort. However, things didn't quite work out as planned. After the news came out in 2008 that Anderson was planning on making an eco-friendly hotel, not much else was ever said on the subject again. We’re thinking that finances might have played a big part in the delayed construction of Anderson’s beach resort.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-tim-mcgraw-and-faith-hill><strong>4. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Power couple&nbsp;<a title="Tim Mcgraw Net Worth" href=#>Tim McGraw</a> and <a title="Faith Hill Net Worth" href=#>Faith hill</a> are the proud owners of their own Bahamian island named Goat Cay. The couple’s island is located in Exumas, an area that many celebrities like <a title="Oprah Winfrey Net Worth" href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a>, <a title="Michael Jordan Net Worth" href=#>Michael Jordan</a> and Johnny Depp seem to enjoy. Reportedly, the island is fully developed and boasts beautiful sandy beaches, and trails throughout. Although the price of the island is not clear, it’s obvious that the couple had to shell out some big bucks in order to purchase their own private paradise. Let’s hope that our future vacations will be as romantic as a stay on Goat Cay is sure to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-shakira><strong>3. Shakira&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Although many celebrities choose to purchase a private island all on their own, <a title="Shakira Net Worth" href=#>Shakira</a> made the decision to buy her own paradise with some close friends. The singer shares ownership of Bonds Cay with Roger Islands and Alejandro Sanz. The island costs $16 million and is located in the Bahamas. It boasts 700 acres and already has private beaches, art galleries, and luxury hotels. But the trio isn’t done developing their island just yet. Apparently the group wants to turn the island into an artist’s retreat. They are continuing to develop the future artist’s paradise.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-johnny-depp><strong>2. Johnny Depp&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Spending your days on a private island with <a title="Johnny Depp Net Worth" href=#>Johnny Depp</a> is something dreams are made of. For one special lady, <a title="Amber Heard Net Worth" href=#>Amber Heard</a>, this dream is a reality. Her husband Johnny Depp owns an island called Little Hall Pond in Exumas. Apparently, the actor <a href=#>fell in love</a> with the island after filming one of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies there. According to Forbes.com, the actor purchased the island at $3.6 million. Regarding his island, Depp told Vanity Fair, “I don’t think I’d ever seen any place so pure and beautiful. You can feel your pulse rate drop about 20 beats. It’s instant freedom.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-leonardo-dicaprio><strong>1. Leonardo DiCaprio&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a title="Leonardo DiCaprio Net Worth" href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> purchased his beautiful island in 2005, for a reported $1.75 million. The island is located between Belize and Ambergris Caye, boasts 104 acres, and is right by the famous Barrier Reef. The star, who is passionate about the environment, plans to turn it into a prime example of sustainable development. Luckily for us, DiCaprio even plans to open up his island to the public. He is in talks with Fours Seasons Hotels and Resorts to create a green hotel. So who knows, maybe one day you will be vacationing on the beach with none other than Leonardo DiCaprio by your side.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>forbes.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>hellomagazine.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5BpZJydnJqvtHnWoaZmp6ejerW0xKKpZqeno3qtwdeuqaKnpah6sb7Ir5itnV2ewK2tzZ2qaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-celebs-who-own-their-own-luxurious-private-islands.html&text=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Own%20Their%20Own%20Luxurious%20Private%20Islands&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebs-who-own-their-own-luxurious-private-islands.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebs-who-own-their-own-luxurious-private-islands.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Own%20Their%20Own%20Luxurious%20Private%20Islands" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-celebs-who-own-their-own-luxurious-private-islands.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Own%20Their%20Own%20Luxurious%20Private%20Islands" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebs-who-own-their-own-luxurious-private-islands.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Own%20Their%20Own%20Luxurious%20Private%20Islands" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebs-who-own-their-own-luxurious-private-islands.html&description=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Own%20Their%20Own%20Luxurious%20Private%20Islands" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./a-peek-inside-john-travoltas-airport-mansion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Peek Inside John Travolta's Airport Mansion">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./43269.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=" Lolita Agustine">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
