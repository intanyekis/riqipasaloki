This actress rose to fame after joining the cast of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">teen drama television series, “Dawson’s Creek”</a>. She starred opposite James Van Der Beek, Joshua Jackson, and Michelle Williams. The show ran for six seasons before its final episode aired in 2003.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, Holmes has grown into a woman, married&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A-list actor, Tom Cruise</a>, and given birth to a daughter named Suri. In recent years, Holmes has tried to keep her personal life private. She has also been busy with her career, as she's continued working on feature films and television projects. She’s is also one of those&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actors who has done work behind the scenes</a>. Here are 15 things that she’s been up to since “Dawson’s Creek”:</p><h2 id=she-had-a-partnership-with-nabisco><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>She Had A Partnership With Nabisco</span></h2><p>In 2016, Nabisco kicked off its “115 Moments of Joy” campaign in celebration of its 115th anniversary. In a statement, Nabisco explained, “To generate excitement around the "115 Moments of Joy" promotion, Nabisco and actress Katie Holmes surprised an unsuspecting Calabasas, CA shopper with $115! Why? Because she simply was spotted with RITZ Crackers in her shopping cart.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-went-on-to-play-rachel-dawes-in-batman-begins><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>She&nbsp;Went On To Play Rachel Dawes In “Batman Begins”</span></h2><p>Playing Christian Bale’s leading lady was arguably the biggest role that Holmes has landed since “Dawson’s Creek.” Unfortunately, Holmes couldn’t return for the film’s sequel, something that director Christopher Nolan himself felt bad about. According to Business Insider, Nolan said in an interview, “Katie wasn’t available for the role, which I wasn’t very happy about, but these things happen, and I was very, very fortunate that Maggie [Gyllenhaal] was able to take it over.”</p><h2 id=she-once-had-a-fashion-line-named-holmes-amp-yang><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>She Once Had A Fashion Line Named Holmes & Yang</span></h2><p>Yes, you heard it right. Holmes once ventured into the world of high fashion through a collaboration with her former stylist, Jeanne Yang. Unfortunately, Holmes & Yang was discontinued after the two ended their partnership. A source even told Page Six&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that Katie Holmes and Jeanne Yang started arguing</a>, “Things have definitely soured between them. Holmes’ rep also confirmed, “The Holmes & Yang partnership has ended.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-once-took-up-the-title-of-oats-ambassador-for-quaker-oats><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>She Once Took Up The Title Of Oats Ambassador For Quaker Oats</span></h2><p>When Quaker Oats launched its 'OATOBER' campaign in 2016, Holmes readily supported the initiative. In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quaker Oats press release</a>, she said, “Oatmeal is one of my favorite breakfast choices because it's delicious and packed with nutrition. For me, and I think for most families in America, Quaker is oatmeal.”</p><p>According to Marie Claire, the actress also shared her favorite oatmeal recipe, which includes sriracha, seeds, and truffle oil. “It tastes like risotto,” Holmes remarked.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Little Known Facts About Jamie Foxx And Katie Holmes’ Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=she-made-a-guest-appearance-in-the-tv-series-eli-stone><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>She Made A Guest Appearance In The TV Series “Eli Stone”</span></h2><p>On the ABC series, she played a clumsy lawyer named Grace Fuller who ended up doing a song and dance number. Actor Jonny Lee Miller, who played Eli Stone, had nothing but praise for Holmes. He told Access Hollywood, “She is amazing in the show. She was just a really, really nice person to have around. Really great work ethic. She was awesome.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-made-the-cashmere-bra-famous><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Made The Cashmere Bra Famous</span></h2><p>The actress was snapped wearing a cashmere bra over a cardigan and soon, her unique fashion look became popular. While speaking with Standard, Holmes explained her inspiration for the look, saying, “I thought it would be good if I was in a cabin sitting by the fire and wore the [matching] sweater over it. That's how my brain works. But then I was like, ‘Oh, wait, I'm not in a cabin, and I'm not going to a cabin.’ I still thought I could pull it off, though. I had noticed other people wearing bras with blazers.”</p><h2 id=she-played-jackie-kennedy-in-the-tv-mini-series-the-kennedys><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>She Played Jackie Kennedy In The TV Mini-Series “The Kennedys”</span></h2><p>The eight-part series was viewed as controversial from the very start - supporters of the Kennedy clan were reportedly against the release of the mini-series. Producer, Joel Surnow, thought it was all because of politics.</p><p>He told The Hollywood Reporter, “Because I am a known conservative, it appears that I was deemed unfit to be the person to produce this miniseries.” He added, “I wasn’t Emmy Award-winning Joel Surnow, I was Rush Limbaugh’s and Roger Ailes’ friend Joel Surnow. And that’s all that mattered.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-briefly-appeared-as-naomi-in-the-tv-series-how-i-met-your-mother><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Briefly Appeared As Naomi In The TV Series “How I Met Your Mother”</span></h2><p>As fans of the show will recall, Holmes played Naomi, better known as Ted’s “Slutty Pumpkin.” One of Naomi's cutest lines on the show was the line that she delivered to Josh Radnor’s 'Ted', saying: “Ted, I've been looking for the hot Hanging Chad for the last nine Halloweens. I've waded through a parade of Big Lebowskis, Harry Potters, Antoine Dodsons and the jackass who always dresses as laundry.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katie Holmes’ Hollywood Career From 1998 To 2019, In Pictures</a></span></p><h2 id=she-had-a-recurring-role-in-showtime-s-ray-donovan><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Had A Recurring Role In Showtime’s “Ray Donovan”</span></h2><p>While speaking about how she got involved with the show, Holmes told Hola, “I’ve been a fan of the show, and I met with the wonderful creators for this season. They told me about this character, and I thought it was interesting for where the show was and Liev’s character.” She added, “It was a chance to play someone I’ve never played, then they told me about the braces for the character and I was like ‘I’m in.'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-reprised-her-role-as-the-former-first-lady-in-the-mini-series-the-kennedys-after-camelot><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Reprised Her Role As The Former First Lady In The Mini-Series “The Kennedys After Camelot”</span></h2><p>Speaking about the second time she portrayed Jackie Kennedy, Holmes told Hello, “The role was a responsibility and, at times, a daunting challenge. I mean, everyone knows the Kennedys and their story. But over the two miniseries, my character evolves from a young ingénue, to the President’s wife, to JFK’s widow going through struggles as a single mother, to remarrying Aristotle Onassis — there’s a big character arc there. It was a privilege portraying her.” Holmes also directed the series’ third episode.</p><h2 id=she-s-been-doing-some-volunteer-work><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She’s Been Doing Some Volunteer Work</span></h2><p>“Volunteering is something I incorporate into my life. I'm mindful of being part of my community, and I go to homeless shelters to help out,” Holmes told Shape.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the same interview, she said: “I also recently traveled to a refugee camp in Greece with Artolution [a community-based public art organization that seeks social change through collaborative art making], and that was very eye-opening. There are so many refugees all over the world, and it's incredible to see the strength of people who leave such dire circumstances to start over someplace else. That's work that I'm continuing to learn about and be involved with.”</p><h2 id=she-starred-in-the-film-dear-dictator-where-seth-green-sucked-her-toes><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Starred In The Film “Dear Dictator” Where Seth Green Sucked Her Toes</span></h2><p>The film also stars Michael Caine, a veteran actor that Katie Holmes admires very much. She told The Sun, “I love Michael Caine and working with him in a comedy was so much fun.” She explained, “He plays a dictator who moves into our house, unbeknown to me, and ends up living in the basement. I play a woman who has a teenage daughter who is rebelling to the point of having a dictator from another country come and live in our house.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Suri Cruise Is 14: Here’s Everything We Know About Tom And Katie’s Daughter</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-made-an-uncredited-cameo-in-the-film-ocean-s-eight><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She Made An Uncredited Cameo In The Film “Ocean’s Eight”</span></h2><p>While speaking about her experience on the set of the all-female action flick with People, Holmes remarked, “The cast is wonderful. It’s people that you want to watch and you connect with. And it’s a great director.” She also remarked, “It was really so much fun. It’s going to be a great female caper film. It won’t disappoint.”</p><h2 id=she-played-patrick-stewart-s-muse-in-the-recent-film-coda><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Played Patrick Stewart’s Muse In The Recent Film, “Coda”</span></h2><p>The film also marks the directorial debut of screenwriter, Claude Lalonde. According to reviews, there is something predictable about the film. Nonetheless, both actors deliver powerful performances.</p><p>As Variety notes, “The film’s overall tact and discretion enhances the dramatic and emotional evolution of the bond between Henry and Helen, which is rendered with low-key sincerity by a scrupulously restrained Stewart and an arrestingly ambiguous Holmes.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-recently-starred-in-the-horror-mystery-brahms-the-boy-ii><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She Recently Starred In The Horror Mystery “Brahms: The Boy II”</span></h2><p>While discussing the movie with Slash Film, Holmes explained, “My character is a mother who’s gone through a traumatic experience, and so we go to the country to sort of heal. She is starting to feel very uneasy because of the influence of this doll on my child. In the process of trying to heal, he’s getting more and more terrified. And I felt like that was very relatable for parents. It was a challenge.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Times Suri Was More Fashionable Than Katie Holmes</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYriiwMieZKGnnKKytHnHmqpmmpWau27Bz2arqGWjnruksYydmLCrn6PAbq%2FRnpykZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-katie-holmes-has-been-up-to-since-dawsons-creek.html&text=Here%27s%20What%20Katie%20Holmes%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Dawson%27s%20Creek&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-katie-holmes-has-been-up-to-since-dawsons-creek.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-katie-holmes-has-been-up-to-since-dawsons-creek.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Katie%20Holmes%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Dawson%27s%20Creek" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-katie-holmes-has-been-up-to-since-dawsons-creek.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Katie%20Holmes%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Dawson%27s%20Creek" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-katie-holmes-has-been-up-to-since-dawsons-creek.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Katie%20Holmes%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Dawson%27s%20Creek" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-katie-holmes-has-been-up-to-since-dawsons-creek.html&description=Here%27s%20What%20Katie%20Holmes%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Dawson%27s%20Creek" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./indiana-massara.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Indiana Massara">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ali-vitali-bio-wiki-age-height-husband-salary-net-worth-and-nbc-3.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ali Vitali Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Salary, Net worth and NBC">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
