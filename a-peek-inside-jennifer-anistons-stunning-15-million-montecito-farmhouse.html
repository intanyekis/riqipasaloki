The <a href=#>actress who followed certain rules to succeed</a> still hasn't lost her appeal. Of course, there were rumors that she was dating <a href=#>Brad Pitt after his divorce from Angelina Jolie</a> when they were seen together in London earlier this year since the two are close friends after their failed marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even so, no one knows much about Aniston's personal life aside from what we read in tabloids or see on TV shows like Friends or films like Office Space, both of which feature her as one of their main characters. So when news broke recently about Aniston buying a new home in Montecito that cost over 15 million dollars from Oprah Winfrey, many have speculations about it. Here is more information about the new house acquired by Aniston</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="A Peek Inside Jennifer Aniston's Splendid Car Collection" href=#>A Peek Inside Jennifer Aniston's Splendid Car Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=sprawling-estate-with-crazy-amenities-and-luxurious-barn>Sprawling Estate With Crazy Amenities And Luxurious Barn</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer Aniston is a regular on the list of Most Popular Actresses, but she's never been a tabloid fixture like her peers. A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$15 million ranch in Montecito </a>is a vast sprawling estate with lots of acreage, crazy amenities, and a luxury barn. But when she got into real estate shopping mode after her split from Justin Theroux, she landed on this 7-acre Santa Barbara property that came pre-built by builder Mark Mills.</p><p>It has two bedrooms and three bathrooms, one with a shower surrounded by mirrors which is perfect for some <a href=#>shower thoughts which can change one's life</a>. Included in the amenities is an office/gym room off the master suite, and an eat-in kitchen with custom cabinetry. There's also an infinity pool overlooking the ocean and mountain views all around; look closely enough at those photos and maybe spot Brad Pitt moving his stuff out of storage soon. Jennifer Aniston's new home is also surrounded by beautiful landscaping and views of the mountains.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This makes it an ideal home for anyone who wants to enjoy nature while still near town for shopping and restaurants. In addition to being an excellent place for entertaining guests, this home is also perfect for relaxing with the family. The property features a large swimming pool, spa, gazebo, and fire pit. It's also surrounded by beautiful landscaping that makes it easy to forget about the hustle and bustle of everyday life.</p><h2 id=stunning-house-located-on-the-hillside>Stunning House Located On The Hillside</h2><p>While the main house in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">farmhouse previously owned by Oprah</a> is obviously charming, it also clocks in at only 2,600 square feet. What's more, there are no stables or horse pastures so far as we can tell. So instead, Aniston opted for something somewhat rustic. And it looks incredible. The property has 10 acres—plenty of space to roam around on its own two feet—and includes an outdoor kitchen area and dining area with a gigantic grill perfect for hosting big parties with friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's unclear whether Aniston will be able to move right into this stunning new home or if she'll have to wait until 2020 since she also have a <a href=#>splendid $21 Million Bel-Air Mansion</a>, when more construction on the property has been completed. The house sits on a hillside lot with lush landscaping and lovely views of the Santa Ynez Mountains and the ocean.</p><p>The property shows a charming view with an existing fence; plenty of stars have gates that have a lovely ranch house feel to them. The home is in Montecito, a beautiful town on the border of Santa Barbara County and Santa Ynez Valley. It has a lot of windows to take advantage of the views, which include the nearby mountains and ocean. This area is famous for its beautiful weather, friendly residents, and proximity to many local attractions. The home is on a large lot that provides plenty of room for entertaining guests or relaxing with family members.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lavish-mastersuite-that-comes-with-an-incredible-fireplace>Lavish Mastersuite That Comes With An Incredible Fireplace</h2><p>The home is lovely and airy, with clean lines, white walls, and many glass doors that let light in and provide views from every room inside. No need to snatch a<a href=#> luxurious hotel room for cheap</a> since the home is extremely luxurious. It's got some modern elements like skylights built into the ceiling and funky light fixtures, but it's still classic enough to attract people who want a home that doesn't look totally out of date in five years. It has an open-concept living space on the main floor where one can enjoy meals at either end of the dining table or curl up on one side while watching TV on the other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The living area also has a cozy nook with built-in bookshelves where everyone can store all their favorite novels or even hide away if needing some alone time! Inside, the home features five bedrooms and six bathrooms. The master suite has a fireplace, sitting area, and spa-like bathroom.</p><p>Two more great bedrooms on the home's main level can also be used as guest rooms or office space. The home also features an outdoor living room perfect for entertaining guests. Several patios provide plenty of space to set up outdoor dining areas or fire pits. An infinity pool and spa are also located on the property, which can be used year-round to its warm climate. The home is situated in the exclusive neighborhood of Hidden Hills, which is known for its privacy and luxury.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="9 Ways Jennifer Aniston Earns And Spends Her Fortune" href=#>9 Ways Jennifer Aniston Earns And Spends Her Fortune</a></span></p><p>Sources:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> SCMP</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Deal</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaaZaCasqx5yKeqopyVYremus2inZ6qXZa7qr%2FTqKWsZaOpwq%2B6yKeeZmllYrqquMuipqdlnaS7tbHCoquoZZaWv660zq6qnmc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fa-peek-inside-jennifer-anistons-stunning-15-million-montecito-farmhouse.html&text=A%20Peek%20Inside%20Jennifer%20Aniston%27s%20Stunning%20%2415%20Million%20Montecito%20Farmhouse&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-peek-inside-jennifer-anistons-stunning-15-million-montecito-farmhouse.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-peek-inside-jennifer-anistons-stunning-15-million-montecito-farmhouse.html&title=A%20Peek%20Inside%20Jennifer%20Aniston%27s%20Stunning%20%2415%20Million%20Montecito%20Farmhouse" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fa-peek-inside-jennifer-anistons-stunning-15-million-montecito-farmhouse.html&title=A%20Peek%20Inside%20Jennifer%20Aniston%27s%20Stunning%20%2415%20Million%20Montecito%20Farmhouse" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fa-peek-inside-jennifer-anistons-stunning-15-million-montecito-farmhouse.html&title=A%20Peek%20Inside%20Jennifer%20Aniston%27s%20Stunning%20%2415%20Million%20Montecito%20Farmhouse" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-peek-inside-jennifer-anistons-stunning-15-million-montecito-farmhouse.html&description=A%20Peek%20Inside%20Jennifer%20Aniston%27s%20Stunning%20%2415%20Million%20Montecito%20Farmhouse" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./allen-ferrell-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-132847-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Allen Ferrell Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./this-hotel-in-tennessee-celebrates-christmas-all-year-round.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Hotel In Tennessee Celebrates Christmas All Year Round">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
