Here are the details of what he really thinks about his co-star!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-daniel-radcliffe-really-think-of-robert-pattinson>What Daniel Radcliffe Really Think Of Robert Pattinson?</h2><p>Some fans may feel Robert Pattinson and Daniel Radcliffe are close friends because they co-starred in a huge franchise together.</p><p>However, the Harry Potter lead actor Daniel admitted in a recent interview on The Jonathan Ross Show that it is not the case. He explained that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they haven’t spoken in a long time</a>, though he had kind things to say about Robert from when they worked together in the film.</p><p>He said, “Literally the first, I was in New York about to do Equus, and I was on the Westside Highway and I turned around and saw this billboard and I was like, ‘What, I know that guy!’ I hadn’t heard of the Twilight books at the time; I hadn’t been aware of that phenomenon. And so yeah, it’s odd.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Daniel then went on to describe his relationship with Robert, saying, “We have a very strange relationship now where we basically only communicate through journalists. We haven’t seen each other in ages. Because everyone assumes we’re kind of great mates, but I’ve met him, he’s a lovely guy when I worked with him.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Daniel Radcliffe’s Life Has Changed Since The Last ‘Harry Potter’ Film</a></span></p><p>Well, Daniel Radcliffe and Robert Pattinson’s “strange” relationship isn’t really because they dislike one another, but because they actually haven’t kept in touch since then. And even if they aren't friends, it may be interesting for the two to talk about their parallel careers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Harry Potter and Twilight are two very different juggernauts, they both started out as the top actors for two similarly successful book series turned blockbuster films. The two actors might be able to bond over a few other shared experiences, too, such as their later migrations to indie films.</p><h2 id=how-are-daniel-and-robert-rsquo-s-career-after-harry-potter>How Are Daniel And Robert’s Career After Harry Potter?</h2><p>Despite their shared appearances in the Harry Potter films, for the time being, Daniel has clarified his relationship with Robert — ensuring that fans are aware of the facts.</p><p>Robert and Daniel (who played Harry in all eight films) had a few sequences together, including Cedric's death in the last act, which acts as a crucial turning point for the entire series. The duo’s careers have diverged since then.</p><p>Robert Pattinson, who made a major cameo as Cedric Diggory, an earnest Hufflepuff who is chosen to be one of the champions in the Triwizard Tournament in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, became a household name after starring in Twilight. He starred in the famous franchise as the heartthrob vampire <a href=#>Edward Cullen and as the onscreen partner of Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan</a>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After it ended, he shifted his focus to independent films for several years. He starred in films such as Tenet (2020), The Devil All The Time (2020), The Lighthouse (2019), The King (2019), High Life (2018), The Lost City of Z (2016), and more.</p><p>He is also set to return to the big screen as the <a href=#>caped crusader Bruce Wayne in the DC Comic film The Batman</a> in the near future.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>DC Fans Are Obsessed With Robert Pattinson’s Voice In ‘The Batman’</a></span></p><p>Daniel Radcliffe, on the other hand, stayed with Harry Potter to the very end. Though his face will long be associated with the bright-eyed 11-year-old who read his Hogwarts letter next to a beautifully misspelled birthday cake in a damp shack, he has gone on to play a wide range of parts in the film business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Radcliffe has created a reputation for himself in the independent film world. He's also amassed a long number of West End and Broadway theatre credits.</p><p>In fact, he's shown to be quite the comedian, having appeared in a number of lighter flicks, including the rom-com What If, which he co-starred in with Zoe Kazan, and Guns Akimbo, which he co-starred in with Australian actor Samara Weaving. He also dabbled in theatre, revealing everything (literally everything) on stage in his Broadway musical Equus.</p><p>More recently, he co-stars with Steve Buscemi (who also executive produces the program), Geraldine Viswanathan, Karan Soni, and Jon Bass in the TBS anthology comedy series Miracle Workers. He is one of the lead actors and executive producers of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, Daniel Radcliffe will star alongside Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum in next year's The Lost City. It was also announced last month that he, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and a number of other actors and key contributors from the Harry Potter films will reunite for an <a href=#>HBO Max reunion special</a> to commemorate the franchise's 20th anniversary. Perhaps Robert Pattinson can join for a quick appearance too!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Dark Truth About Daniel Radcliffe’s Performance in ‘Harry Potter’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqaZmrluvsCdmqWhlpuybr%2FTq5inn5Viv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxedGomZ6qpGK9osDToqWsp55k</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdaniel-radcliffe-strange-relationship-robert-pattinson.html&text=Daniel%20Radcliffe%20Admits%20Having%20%27Strange%27%20Relationship%20With%20Robert%20Pattinson&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdaniel-radcliffe-strange-relationship-robert-pattinson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdaniel-radcliffe-strange-relationship-robert-pattinson.html&title=Daniel%20Radcliffe%20Admits%20Having%20%27Strange%27%20Relationship%20With%20Robert%20Pattinson" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdaniel-radcliffe-strange-relationship-robert-pattinson.html&title=Daniel%20Radcliffe%20Admits%20Having%20%27Strange%27%20Relationship%20With%20Robert%20Pattinson" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdaniel-radcliffe-strange-relationship-robert-pattinson.html&title=Daniel%20Radcliffe%20Admits%20Having%20%27Strange%27%20Relationship%20With%20Robert%20Pattinson" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdaniel-radcliffe-strange-relationship-robert-pattinson.html&description=Daniel%20Radcliffe%20Admits%20Having%20%27Strange%27%20Relationship%20With%20Robert%20Pattinson" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./james-wans-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="James Wans net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./conner-jipson-motorcycle-accident-death-cause-and-crash-details-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Conner Jipson Motorcycle Accident: Death Cause And Crash Details">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
