Her Emmy-nominated role in Hulu's The Act, as well as her enormously successful Kissing Booth films on Netflix has cemented her as "one to watch". And it's about time after near-endless roles as a child star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seriously, this gorgeous young woman has been acting basically since she came out of the womb, so her success was inevitable.</p><p>But Joey King is also in the news a lot for her romantic life. Namely her relationship with her Kissing Booth co-star, Jacob Elordi. Their relationship was hot and heavy and caught the attention of the press. But like many young romances, it fizzled out. While Joey has kept her subsequent relationships on the down low, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacob went on to publicly date Zendaya</a> and now Kaia Gerber. During all that,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joey was forced to work with her ex</a> on The Kissing Booth 2, as many notable stars have. This added attention to an already awkward situation. Therefore, we can imagine that this is one of the reasons why she keeps her personal life as private as she can.</p><p>This includes her relationships with her two sisters, Hunter and Kelli.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Joey King Has A Completely Secret Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joey-s-sister-hunter-is-also-an-accomplished-actor>Joey's Sister Hunter Is Also An Accomplished Actor</h2><p>Joey and her stunning older sister Hunter have a noticeable resemblance, but the two have had completely different careers.&nbsp;Hunter is best known for her role as Summer Newman on The Young And The Restless, as well as her role in Life In Pieces, Hollywood Heights, and in A Girl Like Her.</p><p>During her recent interview on The Howard Stern Show, Joey went into detail about what it's like to have a sister who is also an actor. Howard asked Joey if either she or Hunter were ever jealous of each other. Even though Hunter is a working actor in Hollywood, Joey is by far the bigger star. Therefore, Howard wondered if Hunter had built up any animosity for her sister's notable success... But Joey says "No!".</p><p>Apparently, Joey and Hunter are exceptionally close. In her interview with Stern, Joey went into detail about how much she and her sister support each other. But you need look no further than their Instagram account for proof of that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hunter and Joey are best-friends</a>.</p><p>While there is a slight age difference between them, Joey and Hunter hang out non-stop. They are often seen playing around at Disneyland, out for lunch, or even on long walks. The two are also known for filming their own version of carpool karaoke.</p><p>The fact that they get along so well is great since they live together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joey King Got A Mysteriously Haunting Blood Condition On Set Of â€˜The Conjuringâ€™</a></span></p><h2 id=joey-bought-a-house-where-she-lives-with-her-mother-and-sister>Joey Bought A House Where She Lives With Her Mother And Sister</h2><p>In the same interview with Howard Stern, Joey King revealed that she bought a house in Los Angeles where she has been living with her mom and sister for multiple years. Since Joey started making bank at such a young age, her finances were organized by her mother, Jamie. Joey is exceptionally close to her mother, who is often seen accompanying her to various film events.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hunter also lives with them, occupying the basement level of the gorgeous house. At one stage, even Hunter's fiance was living in the house with them.</p><p>During the L.A. quarantine during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, this closeness gave Joey a ton of happiness. On her Instagram, you can see how she and her family celebrated each day with a unique theme. With all the dress-up and celebrating, quarantine was a blast.</p><p>Joey also loves to live with her sister since she gets to prank her. While promoting The Act<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on The Ellen Show in 2019</a>, Joey even admitted to switching out Hunter's deodorant for cream cheese on April Fool's Day.</p><p>Nowadays, the sisters are working on a secret project that they'll be co-starring in together.</p><h2 id=where-does-joey-s-eldest-sister-fit-into-all-of-this>Where Does Joey's Eldest Sister Fit Into All Of This?</h2><p>While Joey's relationship with Hunter is the one we see the most of, it appears that she is also quite close to her eldest sister, Kelli. However, it must be tough for Kelli since she doesn't live with Joey like her other sister Hunter does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Very little is known about the dynamic between Joey and Kelli, mainly because Kelli remains out of the public eye. Rarely is she featured on any of her sisters' social media pages, although they usually note that she's there. Perhaps she's camera-shy?</p><p>Kelli spent a little time pursuing acting, but by 2012 she gave it up in favor of another career.</p><p>According to The Daily Mail, in 2016, Kelli was involved in a horrific accident when she was hit by an 18-wheeler while biking to work. Luckily, she has made a full recovery. During that time, both Joey and Hunter were constantly by her side.</p><p>While Kelli has successfully remained out of the public eye, it does appear that she is part of the King sisterly trifecta.</p><p>It's truly touching to see how close Joey is with both of her sisters!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things We Need To See In The Kissing Booth 3</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6q7vEsmSkoZ6cwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mrqKsmGK1pr6MrKCsrJWnwHA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-about-joey-kings-relationship-with-her-sisters.html&text=The%20Truth%20About%20Joey%20King%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Sisters&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-about-joey-kings-relationship-with-her-sisters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-joey-kings-relationship-with-her-sisters.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Joey%20King%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Sisters" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-truth-about-joey-kings-relationship-with-her-sisters.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Joey%20King%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Sisters" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-joey-kings-relationship-with-her-sisters.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Joey%20King%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Sisters" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-about-joey-kings-relationship-with-her-sisters.html&description=The%20Truth%20About%20Joey%20King%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Sisters" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1233004-cinta-de-oro-sin-cara-feud-divine-justice.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cinta de Oro Reveals How Sin Cara vs. Sin Cara Feud Was First Pitched, How He Got Divine Ju">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jillian-cardarelli-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-667987-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jillian Cardarelli Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
