For a while, the couple was idolized because both were hugely successful on their own. In 2009, Kelis and Nas made the joyful announcement of expecting their first child together, but their marriage was deteriorating simultaneously.</p><p>What initially seemed like a perfect match in the music industry ended in heartbreak, leading Kelis to file for divorce while she was seven months pregnant. It wasn't until 2018 that Kelis came forward and said the rapper had assaulted her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kelis-nas-grammys-2008.jpg><p>Following a period of healing from her tumultuous relationship with Nas, Kelis found love once again, this time with Mike Mora. The couple tied the knot in 2014, embarking on a journey of love and creativity together.</p><p>The couple, who has two kids together, shared a vision of a beautiful future, purchasing a farm in 2018 with the intention of cultivating their own food and living a sustainable lifestyle.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Milkshake’ Is Still Earning Cash Today, But Kelis Hasn’t Seen A Dime</a></span></p><p>It was a testament to their shared values and dreams.

Little did he know that his life was about to take a devastating turn. As he lay in a hospital bed during the midst of the pandemic, he felt the weight of his diagnosis and the loneliness that accompanied it.</p><p>Mike shared his story not only to raise awareness about his condition but also to inspire others facing similar challenges.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Beyonce And Kelis?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He wrote, “I want to be able to help those that might be experiencing something like this -- a life-altering disease full of questions and doubt -- maybe, hopefully.
