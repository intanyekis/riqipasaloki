Additionally, he is the second child of parents, Rumiko Kitayama and Clifford Kitayama.</p><p>Apparently, he has an older brother, Daniel Kitayama, who, in fact, is also a golfer.</p><p>As we all know, Kurt has Asian looks, and in one of the interviews, he had opened up, stating he is of Asian descent/ethnicity. Well, his mother is Japanese.</p><p>Moving on, Kurt commenced playing golf while he was just a five-year-old.&nbsp;</p><p>To elaborate, he was first introduced to golf by his family friend. Following it, he often played rounds of golf alongside his older brother at Butte Creek Country Club.</p><p>Afterward, he took&nbsp;lessons from Butte Creek Head Pro Mike Mattingly.</p><p>According to the sources, Kitayama was extensive with his game and consistently applied every tip Mattingly had suggested.</p><p>However, growing up, golf was not his first love all the time. Back when he used to be in grade four, Kurt had a passion for basketball.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Learn about <a href=# rel=noopener>Trevor Immelman Bio: Wife, Golf Swing, Net Worth>>>&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></strong></p><h2>Education and Introduction to Golf</h2><p>Kurt Kitayama attended Chico High School.

Altogether, he also led his basketball team to the 2011 California Northern Section Title.</p><p>Moreover, Kitayama also partook in the Championship games when he took his victory over their city-rival Pleasant Valley High School.</p><p>Furthermore, later in his high school days, he shifted to golf after realizing he could make it further with it rather than basketball.&nbsp;</p><p>As a junior back in 2007–2008, Kurt even played at the University of Hawaii at Hilo with his brother, Daniel. After certain years of playing likewise, the American-born then started working as a professional caddie.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, he also starred at the&nbsp;2008 U.S. Open&nbsp;course&nbsp;Torrey Pines, South Course,&nbsp;San Diego, California.

However, he is not afraid to be tough on anyone that befalls him.</p><p>As often, Kitayama’s former coach Kevin Wilkerson would state, “Kurt can rub people the wrong way because he’s so competitive.” Apart from it, Kurt has avid confidence in himself.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to that, during his college days, Kurt even gained a weird nickname, ‘The Project.’</p><p>Indeed, it was not a flattering name back then. As he revealed the secret behind the nickname, Kurt struggled a lot during his freshman year.</p><p>To put it in simple words, he wasn’t a good golfer and, thus, would only try and work hard on his games. That was when the director of golf at Southern Highlands Golf Club (in Las Vegas) gave him that nickname.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, that very name stuck with him for the rest of the time.
