He didn't exactly find it buried with the bones of a replicant, nor did he find it stashed away in a notebook. Here are the facts and&nbsp;figures of Gosling's career.</p><h2 id=his-salary-escalated-fast>His Salary Escalated Fast</h2><p>We're not sure how much Gosling made when he first started on The Mickey Mouse Club, but we can tell you that he was one of the most successful cast members to come out of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gosling's first role out of Disney was was in an episode in the show Are You Afraid of the Dark? in 1995. According to Statistic Brain,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he could have earned anywhere between $2,000 to $8,000 for just a single episode</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Gosling's Best Movies (According to IMDB)</a></span></p><p>Within the next year, he gained&nbsp;tons of roles in small television appearances&nbsp;and made a boatload of money doing it.&nbsp;First came an episode on The Adventures of Shirley Holmes ($10,000/episode),&nbsp;Goosebumps ($12,000/episode),&nbsp;Flash Forward ($14,000/episode),&nbsp;Avonlea, Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, and Dream House/UFO Encounter (all $20,000/episode), Ready or Not ($25,000/episode), and PSI Factor: Chronicles of the Paranormal ($27,000/episode).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, these numbers aren't exact, but it's obvious that his salary nearly doubled in just one year, as roles kept coming his way.</p><p>In 1998, he starred in his first TV movie, Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy, which earned him $35,000.&nbsp;He then had his longest arc on the television show Breaker High, which earned him $35,000 an episode. Gosling appeared in 44 episodes, so he was paid about $1.5 million for his two years on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Gosling's Biggest Achievements Since 'The Notebook'</a></span></p><p>His salary did not stall after this. He played the titular character in Sam Raimi's Young Hercules and made a herculean amount of money for the only season it aired; $50,000 per episode, $2.5 million for all 50 episodes. Gosling was only 18 years old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A year later, he starred in the TV movie The Unbelievables, making $70,000 alone.</p><h2 id=hollywood-came-calling-with-even-more-money-and-oscar-nominations-eventually>Hollywood Came Calling With Even More Money And Oscar Nominations...Eventually</h2><p>To ring in Y2K, Gosling starred in his first feature film, Disney's Remember the Titans, which made him $50,000. This salary is a little low compared to his television salaries, but you have to remember this was his first big-budget film. Next came The Believer.&nbsp;For this, his first leading role in a film, he made $100,000.</p><p>In 2002, he made&nbsp;$225,000 for The Slaughter Rule and $400,000 for Murder By Numbers, and a year later, he made only $50,000 for The United States of Leland. His salary in Hollywood might have started with highs and lows, but his first million-dollar movie came the next year.</p><p>We know he made at least $1 million (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">along with his female lead Rachel Mc Adams</a>) on The Notebook in 2004. But his salary was less for Stay, banking at $800,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Half Nelson brought its highs and lows too. The low-budget indie film only paid Gosling a thousand a week, and with&nbsp;only a 23-day shooting schedule, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he walked away with about $3,200</a>,&nbsp;the lowest amount he ever made. The ironic thing about it was that Gosling received his first Oscar nomination for his role, even though he'd been severely underpaid. But Gosling said he loved starring in the film because he could relate to his character even though the specifics were different. That's true acting.</p><h2 id=more-increases-came-then-a-brief-dip-and-finally-even-more-money-plue-another-oscar-nod>More Increases Came, Then A Brief Dip,&nbsp;And Finally, Even More Money. Plue Another Oscar Nod</h2><p>After Half Nelson, Gosling went back to earning $1 million and above on films like Fracture ($1 million), Lars and the Real Girl, Blue Valentine (both $2 million), Drive ($1.5 million), Crazy, Stupid, Love. ($6 million), and&nbsp;The Ides of March ($5 million).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gosling had another strange decrease in salary on The Place Beyond the Pines, only making $100,000. This might not seem like a drastic dip, but compared with all his previous films of the time, this is his lowest salary. Maybe he didn't get his usual millions because he was hardly in the film?</p><p>It wasn't too much of a hardship on him. He made $4 million&nbsp;for Gangster Squad, $5 million for The Big Short, and $7 million for The Nice Guys.&nbsp;La La Land earned him another Oscar nomination and another $8 million. Again there was a dip with Song to Song, where he made $150,000, but this probably didn't upset either, considering his next role earned him his highest salary to date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Crazy Things You Never Knew About Ryan Gosling</a></span></p><p>He made $10 million for Blade Runner 2049, making it his highest-earning film. The next year, in 2018, he made another $8 million for First Man, in which he played astronaut legend, Neil Armstrong. That's his last credit before the pandemic happened.</p><p>So you can see that Gosling's salary increased very quickly in his early career, and he was able to maintain a salary of over one million in his later career, for the most part. Gosling doesn't seem&nbsp;like the kind of actor who only signs on to films that will give him a hefty paycheck. He chooses his roles with heavy consideration, even if it's a small film that will make him pennies. That's what La La Land should be about. Choose the stories that need to be told. Not the paycheck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Are All The Women That Have Been Linked To Ryan Gosling</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9ZmqbKZnmK0sL%2FLoqWgZZGirrS%2FxJ1koaGjYoRxecyio6Whn6N6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheres-how-ryan-gosling-amassed-his-70-million-net-worth.html&text=Here%27s%20How%20Ryan%20Gosling%20Amassed%20His%20%2470%20Million%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-how-ryan-gosling-amassed-his-70-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-how-ryan-gosling-amassed-his-70-million-net-worth.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Ryan%20Gosling%20Amassed%20His%20%2470%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheres-how-ryan-gosling-amassed-his-70-million-net-worth.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Ryan%20Gosling%20Amassed%20His%20%2470%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheres-how-ryan-gosling-amassed-his-70-million-net-worth.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Ryan%20Gosling%20Amassed%20His%20%2470%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-how-ryan-gosling-amassed-his-70-million-net-worth.html&description=Here%27s%20How%20Ryan%20Gosling%20Amassed%20His%20%2470%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kraken-kid.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kraken Kid">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fans-think-this-is-the-reason-why-joey-and-phoebe-never-got-together-on-friends.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fans Think This Is The Reason Why Joey And Phoebe Never Got Together On 'Friends'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
