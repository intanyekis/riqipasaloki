Most notably, Fillion starred in Castle, Firefly and its spin-off movie Serenity.

On top of portraying Chen, O'Neil also began portraying her original character's doppelgÃ¤nger, Sava "Juicy" Wu as the show progressed. Before O'Neil was hired to join the cast of The Rookie, she had been building her name as a singer, and she even won a season of Canadian Idol.

A police sergeant and watch commander with a military background, it was pivotal to The Rookie's success that viewers believed in Grey as a character. Fortunately for The Rookie, Jones is one of those rare actors who manage to make every project they are a part of better.

A major part of the show ever since, Ashmore portrays a defense attorney named Wesley Evers who falls for, marries, and builds a family with Angela Lopez. Before joining the cast of The Rookie, Ashmore built a name for himself by starring in several movies in the X-Men franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that Ashmore has starred in several blockbuster comic book movies, some people may be surprised at where he falls on this list.
