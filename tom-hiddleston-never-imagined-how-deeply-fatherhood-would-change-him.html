And yeah, it’s before and after.”</p><p>Ashton, 39, gave birth to <a href=#>their first child</a> together in 2022, Us Weekly confirmed. “Tom and Zawe are loving being new parents and are filled with joy,” a source exclusively told Us at the time. “They have been having the struggles of new parents and aren’t sleeping much but are thrilled.”</p><p>The actress also recently joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe, playing the villainous Dar-Benn in The Marvels, which hit theaters earlier this month.</p><p>“I’m so proud of her yeah, and she’s terrific in the Marvels,” Hiddleston shared during the podcast while discussing trading tips about playing a supervillain. “I just only saw it recently. Yeah, it has been it has been bizarre to to share those stories. I mean, I kind of want her to talk about her own work in her own way, but but yeah, I’m so proud of her. We’ve had some definitely had some laughs along the way about zippers and bathroom breaks.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tom-hiddleston-never-imagined-how-deeply-fatherhood-would-change-him-02.jpg><p>Earlier this month, Hiddleston was asked if Loki and The Marvels connected, given that the finale debuted on Disney+ at the same time the film hit theaters.</p><p>“I mean, there are connections. Some secret, some not-so-secret,” Hiddleston said while on <a href=#>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>. “I don’t know what the fans think the secret connection is. … My other half is in The Marvels and I’m very proud of her. So there you go.”</p><p>Ashton met Hiddleston in 2018 while they starred on London’s West End in a play called Betrayal alongside Daredevil actor <strong>Charlie Cox</strong>. They brought the show to Broadway in 2019, but their relationship didn’t end there. They confirmed they were dating when they made their red carpet debut as a couple at the Tony Awards the following September 2021.</p><p>The British duo got <a href=#>engaged</a> in early 2022 and Ashton debuted her baby bump the following June.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hiddleston and Ashton were “looking to build a <a href=#>long-term future together</a>,” another source exclusively told Us in March 2022. “[They are] hugely ambitious but still make time to relax and switch off from work as often as they can.”</p><p>The couple’s friends and family “all agree it’s a great match with a ton of potential,” the insider added. “They’re crazy about each other.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatp51itaqww6WcrKyfo3qvsdWeqWahnZa0qrrEnWShp6disaaxz6WwZp6RqbWmvseopp1lp6TCrbCMnJ%2Bappeaeqm1zGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftom-hiddleston-never-imagined-how-deeply-fatherhood-would-change-him.html&text=Tom%20Hiddleston%20Never%20%27Imagined%20How%20Deeply%27%20Fatherhood%20Would%20Change%20Him&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftom-hiddleston-never-imagined-how-deeply-fatherhood-would-change-him.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftom-hiddleston-never-imagined-how-deeply-fatherhood-would-change-him.html&title=Tom%20Hiddleston%20Never%20%27Imagined%20How%20Deeply%27%20Fatherhood%20Would%20Change%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftom-hiddleston-never-imagined-how-deeply-fatherhood-would-change-him.html&title=Tom%20Hiddleston%20Never%20%27Imagined%20How%20Deeply%27%20Fatherhood%20Would%20Change%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftom-hiddleston-never-imagined-how-deeply-fatherhood-would-change-him.html&title=Tom%20Hiddleston%20Never%20%27Imagined%20How%20Deeply%27%20Fatherhood%20Would%20Change%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftom-hiddleston-never-imagined-how-deeply-fatherhood-would-change-him.html&description=Tom%20Hiddleston%20Never%20%27Imagined%20How%20Deeply%27%20Fatherhood%20Would%20Change%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./vickie-guerrero.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vickie Guerrero">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./robbie-gould.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robbie Gould Bio: NFL &amp;amp; Net Worth [2023 Update]">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
