There's a wide variety of reasons why certain siblings fly under the radar in comparison to the person they are related to. That is why it can come as a big surprise to some wrestling fans that people have family in the business.</p><h2 id=ryan-nemeth><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ryan Nemeth</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ryan-Nemeth-cutting-a-promo-Cropped.jpg><p>Ryan Nemeth is a name that will have started to become familiar within professional wrestling due to his work with AEW. However, a lot of people didn't know about him before getting that shot, even though he worked for WWE. He was with the company for several years in developmental, but never quite made it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, his brother has been one of WWE's top stars for the past decade:<a href=#> Dolph Ziggler.</a> Putting the two men together on-screen could have been a good move for WWE, as Ryan is a great talker. However, that never came to be, and instead, he has gone on to find success in movies, and now once again in wrestling.</p><h2 id=eric-angle><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Eric Angle</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kurt-Angle-Eric-Angle.jpg><p>Fans often forget that Kurt Angle has a brother that was also involved in the wrestling business. Eric Angle has had a career in the business just like his brother, although nowhere near the same level of success. He retired shortly after being released from WWE, not sticking with the sport as long as Kurt.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Fans Should Know About Kurt Angle's TNA Run</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He did get a brief run on the main roster <a href=#>with his brother</a>, where they would pull the classic twin magic that the Bellas became famous for, despite the fact they're not twins. The two men do look similar though, and that opened up an opportunity for WWE to play with things.</p><h2 id=solo-sikoa><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Solo Sikoa</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/solo-sikoa-(1).jpg><p>Solo Sikoa is one of WWE's newest wrestlers, having <a href=#>appeared in NXT 2.0.</a> However, a lot of fans are not aware that he is a sibling within the business. That's because his brothers are The Usos. Even though WWE could easily tap into this connection, especially with The Bloodline, they have avoided it completely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He is only fresh in the business, slowly making a name for himself. However, people will soon learn about who Sikoa is and what he's capable of. This could lead to him being a big part of future main roster plans, but for now, a lot of WWE's casual audience isn't aware of him.</p><h2 id=caylee-turner><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Caylee Turner</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Caylee-Turner-wrestling-Cropped.jpg><p>Caylee Turner is someone that a lot of fans aren't aware of as she didn't quite make a major impact in the business. However, she did spend a lot of time in developmental within FCW and NXT. Turner is <a href=#>the sister of Alicia Fox</a>, who went on to have a brilliant career on the main roster.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Last 10 Divas Title Matches, Ranked From Worst To Best</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Turner, on the other hand, didn't quite thrive on the main roster overall.

He was a jobber at the time, often being used as an enhancement star who put over other people. However, he is <a href=#>the half-brother of Jake "The Snake" Roberts</a>.</p><p>Roberts is one of the biggest names in the history of the business, and that is something that everybody was aware of. However, the connection between these two men was never made by WWE, which is why fans didn't make it either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mike-brett-dibiase><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mike/Brett DiBiase</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-DiBiase-family-Cropped.jpg><p>A lot of wrestling fans presume that someone being a second-generation wrestler guarantees that they will become a major star in the business. However, that isn't necessarily the case, as Mike and Brett DiBiase's careers proved. They are the brothers of Ted DiBiase Jr., who became a mainstay on WWE television.</p><p>He was <a href=#>part of Legacy</a> and had a great career until he decided to wrap things up and leave the business. Meanwhile, Mike and Brett never quite made it that far, despite being involved in the wrestling business for a while. Brett did work in FCW, but a knee injury stopped that from continuing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=russ-haas><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Russ Haas</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Haas-Brothers-Cropped.jpg><p>Russ Haas was a gifted performer, and alongside his brother Charlie, they made a formidable tag team. They worked together in WWE's developmental system, but Russ, unfortunately, died of a heart attack. Because of that, a large portion of WWE fans never got to know who he was.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Not Enough Aggression: 10 Failed Tag Teams Of The Ruthless Aggression Era</a></span></p><p>The company had planned for him to be <a href=#>part of Team Angle</a> alongside his brother and Shelton Benjamin.
