The son of Jack Peters, a cook, and Helen Peters, a receptionist, Peters was born John H. Peters in Van Nuys, California. He is of Italian and Cherokee ancestry. Peters entered the family business of hair styling and found success on Hollywood’s Rodeo Drive, where he made many contacts in the business.</p><p>Peters first rose to fame when he started dating Barbra Streisand, the famous singer, and actress, for whom he had created the short wig for the 1974 comedy For Pete’s Sake. Streisand’s 1974 album Butterfly was the next project he worked on, and two songs from it—There Won’t Be Trumpets/A Quiet Thing and God Bless the Child—were later included on her ‘Just For the Record’ box set. In the liner notes, Streisand stated that “no one at the record company shared my enthusiasm.</p><h2><strong>Jon Peters Net Worth In 2023</strong></h2><p>A former hairdresser turned American film producer, Jon Peters has a <strong>$300 million</strong> fortune as of 2023. Peters is best known for directing the 1976 A Star Is Born adaptation, which made over $100 million worldwide, earned him four Oscar nominations, and featured the Oscar-winning song “Evergreen.”</p><p>In 1980, Peters and Peter Guber, a former executive at Casablanca Records and Filmworks, formed a partnership. Guber Peters acquired Chuck Barris Productions. The partnership suffered its greatest setback and greatest financial setback with Batman, which offered Guber and Peters $1 billion to become CEOS.</p><h2><strong>Jon Peters Early Life</strong></h2><p>Helen Peters, a receptionist, and Jack Peters, a cook and former proprietor of a Hollywood diner, welcomed John Peters into the world on June 2, 1945, in Van Nuys, California. In Beverly Hills, California, on Rodeo Drive, his family owned a well-known salon.</p><p>Growing up in a challenging neighborhood, Peter’s father passed away when he was eight years old, and his mother later remarried. When Peter was twelve years old, he was expelled from school and sent to a reform school for a year.</p><h2><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 1976, Jon was the producer of the “A Star Is Born” movie with Barbra Streisand. The movie’s $6 million budget resulted in a worldwide gross of over $100 million and four Academy Award nominations. Peters later produced several platinum and gold albums for multi-platinum-selling recording artist Barbra Streisand. Jon founded Polygram Productions in 1980 with fellow producer Peter Guber.</p><p>Boardwalk Productions was started after producer Neil Bogart joined the group; regrettably, Bogart left in 1982. Films like “Caddyshack,” “An American Werewolf in London,” “Flashdance,” and “The Color Purple” were produced by the Guber-Peters partnership. As a result of their success, Warner Brothers offered them the most lucrative production deal ever.</p><p style=margin-bottom:var(--post-content-gaps);font-size:14px><img decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/bradley-cooper-licorice-pizza-jo.jpg alt width=1254 height=835 sizes="(max-width: 1254px) 100vw, 1254px"></p><p>Warners’ most profitable production to date was “Batman,” a $35 million budgeted film directed by Jon and Peter. As a result of Guber and Peters’ tremendous success, Warner Brothers made them an offer for a deal worth several million dollars. Soon after they signed their contract, Sony Pictures knocked on their door with an offer to buy Guber-Peters Entertainment for $50 million.</p><p>If they concurred, they would serve as co-chairmen of the Sony Pictures board of directors. The only catch was that they were still bound by their contract with Warner Bros. Warner filed a $1 billion contract breach lawsuit against the group and Sony. To end their separate contracts, Sony and Warner Brothers came to a $500 million agreement.</p><p><strong>Read more :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Emily Deschanel Net Worth 2022: How Much Did Bones Actors Get Paid?</a></li><li><a href=#>KSI Net Worth 2022: How Much Money Does The Youtuber Have?</a></li><li><a href=#>Charles Barkley Net Worth 2022: Early Life, NBA Career, Personal Life, And More Details</a></li><li><a href=#>Hoda Kotb Net Worth 2022: Early Life, Career, Personal Life, And More Updates!</a></li></ul><p>Peter Guber and Jon Peters were given the chance to co-chair Sony Pictures as a result. They have never managed a sizable studio before. When they were in charge of Sony, Peters and Guber oversaw the production of a large number of high-profile, expensive films, many of which were commercial flops.</p><p>During Peter Guber’s tenure, Sony lost about $3 billion while spending $8 billion on production and other costs. When Peter and Jon left Sony in the middle of the 1990s, they received separation payments totaling $30–50 million each. Jon bought the Superman movie rights in the 1990s.</p><p>He made several attempts to finish a Superman movie throughout his entire production career, even considering casting Nicolas Cage. Peters has a significant stake in the box office performance of both the 2013 and the 2006 versions of “Man of Steel” and “Superman Returns.”</p><p style="margin-bottom:var(--post-content-gaps);font-size:14px;font-family:public sans,system-ui,sans-serif"><img decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/thr_jon_peters_splash_peters2.jpg alt width=1500 height=844 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></p><p>He then admitted that despite not being involved in their creation, he made $85 million from just those two films. He asked to be taken to the location where Man of Steel was filmed, but producer Christopher Nolan declined. In the 2018 adaptation of “A Star Is Born,” he also played a similar role.</p><h2><strong>Jon Peters Real Estate</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525>Peters has owned a number of very expensive homes, most of which are in Los Angeles. He owned a condo in a high-rise building with three bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a direct elevator. It was in the Remington Building. The 3,200-square-foot house has parquet floors, crown moulding, and custom wall panels that make it feel like a luxury home. Peters put the Westwood condo up for sale in 2019 for $4,195 million.</p><p style=color:#252525>He now lives on a 3,000-acre ranch near Santa Barbara, California, after selling his Beverly Hills estate and a hilltop mansion in the gated community of Beverly Park for $10.5 million and $12 million, respectively.</p><h2><span id=Charity><strong>Charity</strong></span></h2><p>Peters started the Peters Family Foundation, and through it he helps the Christopher Reeve Foundation, Life Rolls On, Homeboy Industries, My Friend’s Place, Cambodian Children’s Fund, Andre Sobel River of Life Foundation, Heartfelt Foundation, The Laurence School, The Sheriff’s Youth Foundation, and many other youth charities.</p><h2><strong>About His Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Jon has gone through four divorces. Lesley Ann Warren, an actress, and singer, and he were wed from 1967 to 1974. He shocked everyone in 2020 when it was made public that he had wed actress/model Pamela Anderson. They did have a brief relationship in the 1980s. Legend has it that Jon once sent flowers to supermodel Vendela Kirsebom using the Sony company jet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX5%2B8r3nPnqueqqNkf3mAk2lm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjon-peters.html&text=Jon%20Peters%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20A%20Real%20Time%20Update%20On%20Jon%20Peters%20Life%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjon-peters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjon-peters.html&title=Jon%20Peters%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20A%20Real%20Time%20Update%20On%20Jon%20Peters%20Life%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjon-peters.html&title=Jon%20Peters%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20A%20Real%20Time%20Update%20On%20Jon%20Peters%20Life%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjon-peters.html&title=Jon%20Peters%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20A%20Real%20Time%20Update%20On%20Jon%20Peters%20Life%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjon-peters.html&description=Jon%20Peters%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20A%20Real%20Time%20Update%20On%20Jon%20Peters%20Life%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kim-kardashian-feet-shoe-size-shoe-collection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Kardashian Feet, Shoe Size &amp;amp; Shoe Collection">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-matt-leblanc-gay-the-rumors-surrounding-anthony-from-friends-578486-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Matt LeBlanc Gay?
