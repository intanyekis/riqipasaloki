An Academy Award winner, Spacey is largely considered by the public to be one of the most talented actors. But when "what was in the box" were disgusting sexual harassment charges - including against a minor - that&nbsp;is seemingly continuing to grow, how on earth are you ever going to watch him act again? Especially some of his more manipulative or creepy characters, such as&nbsp;Se7en,&nbsp;American Beauty&nbsp;and&nbsp;House of Cards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spacey isn't the only actor who has ruined his reputation, and sadly he isn't the only one to assault a minor. Several stars have also been accused of sexual harassment (or worse) or gotten themselves involved in other scandals away from the screen that forever changes how you view their work.</p><p>Included are the repulsive acts that have allegedly been committed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danny Masterson</a>&nbsp;(That '70s Show,&nbsp;The Ranch),&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy Piven</a>&nbsp;(Entourage) and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brett Ratner</a>&nbsp;(Rush Hour), as well as some of the most shocking implosions such as the one that nearly took the life of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jodie Sweetin</a> and a former Power Ranger who won't be doing any morphing behind bars after killing his roommate.</p><p>These are 15 Movies And Shows That Are Forever Ruined Because Of Off-Screen Scandals.</p><h2 id=rush-hour-because-of-brett-ratner><strong>Rush Hour (Because Of Brett Ratner)</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This list is chock-full of actors, but directors are no exception to being able to ruin their legacy. Brett Ratner has been involved with several films that you may have loved, including the Rush Hour franchise and being a producer on multiple big projects including The Revenant.</p><p>But Ratner has had multiple women come out recently and accuse him of harassment or misconduct.</p><p>This includes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Munn</a> who stated that Ratner allegedly pleasured himself in front of her while visiting him on the set of After the Sunset. Years later, he also talked to her about his enjoyment of self-pleasure to her magazines. Ratner has also said in past interviews that he was intimate with Munn a few times, but he later admitted that he was lying about it.</p><h2 id=seinfeld-because-of-michael-richards><strong>Seinfeld (Because Of Michael Richards)</strong></h2><p>Seinfeld has characters that make you laugh, but none may have done it as consistently as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Richards</a> and his portrayal of Cosmo Kramer. His talents were recognized with three wins for Outstanding Supporting Actor at the Emmys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But his career never took off after Seinfeld, in part due to what we're about to talk about. On November 17th, 2006 during a stand-up routine, Richards found himself rattled by an African-American heckler. He proceeded to respond with several racist slurs, a moment that was also captured on video and quickly went viral.</p><p>Richards' has since apologized for his actions, but he may be a lot less funny if you know that his reaction when under pressure was to say racist comments.</p><h2 id=two-and-a-half-men-because-of-angus-t-jones-and-charlie-sheen><strong>Two And A Half Men (Because Of Angus T. Jones And Charlie Sheen)</strong></h2><p>One of the hallmarks of a great television show is the ability to watch it again and again. But considering the amount of hatred that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angus T. Jones</a> threw towards Two And A Half Men, you may find it incredibly hard to rewatch.</p><p>“If you watch ‘Two and a Half Men,’ please stop watching ‘Two and a Half Men.’ I’m on ‘Two and a Half Men’ and I don’t want to be on it," said Jones in 2012.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheen</a>'s high-profile departure from the show also doesn't help things. This included Sheen somehow feeling he was entitled to demanding a 50% raise, despite already being the highest paid actor on television (at close to $2 million per episode) and had been undergoing issues with various substances.</p><h2 id=american-beauty-because-of-kevin-spacey><strong>American Beauty (Because Of Kevin Spacey)</strong></h2><p>Kevin Spacey was one of the most beloved actors in Hollywood. This entire list could literally be full of iconic role after role, but there may not be any one role that is more associated with Spacey than Lester Burnham in American Beauty.</p><p>The role ended up winning Spacey an Academy Award but several elements, including Spacey's friendship with a teenage boy (not to mention lusting over a teenage girl), are sure to make you extra uncomfortable in light of his recent allegations.</p><p>The role does feature talented performances from fellow actors <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allison Janey</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mena Suvari</a> and Wes Bentley (among others), but it may not be enough to save the film for you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=that-70s-show-because-of-danny-masterson><strong>That '70s Show (Because Of Danny Masterson)</strong></h2><p>Danny Masterson may be currently starring on the television series The Ranch, but for many people, he'll always be known as Hyde from That '70s Show. But reports that surfaced in November are sure to leave you uncomfortable.</p><p>Several women, all fellow Scientologists, have accused Masterson of raping them. This includes one incident where a woman alleges she woke up to him having intercourse with her, only for him to then choke her out and continue.</p><p>Masterson has denied all claims, though some sources say Masterson's innocence is fuelled in part by fellow Scientologists defending him.</p><h2 id=above-the-law-because-of-steven-seagal><strong>Above The Law (Because Of Steven Seagal)</strong></h2><p>There are several reports over the years that have talked about how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Seagal</a> is allegedly not the nicest guy in the world to hang out or work with. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julianna Marguiles</a> horrifying tale is sure to top them all. Among being lied to by his assistant that she would not be left alone with Seagal in his hotel room, Marguiles said, “He made sure that I saw his gun, which I’d never seen a gun in real life. I got out of there unscathed. ... I don’t know how I got out of that hotel room. ... I sort of squirmed my way out.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was also reported that Seagal may have tried to initiate with a massage. While this should ruin all Seagal films for you, Marguiles was 23 at the time which places it around 1989 so we're going to put his 1988 acting debut Above The Law on blast.</p><h2 id=full-house-because-of-jodie-sweetin><strong>Full House (Because Of Jodie Sweetin)</strong></h2><p>Jodie Sweetin didn't have any issues while she was filming&nbsp;Full House.&nbsp;The issues came when she stopped making the series. Sweetin's adulthood was rough to say the least, including admitting in a past interview that she started drinking after the show ended.</p><p>Among drinking, Sweetin also used various illegal substances including methamphetamine, crack, ecstasy, and cocaine. So while you may love the classic sitcom, it may be hard to watch and know where those paycheques ended up going. Thankfully Sweetin has since cleaned her life up, perhaps making watching her on&nbsp;Fuller House&nbsp;all the more enjoyable.</p><h2 id=entourage-because-of-jeremy-piven><strong>Entourage (Because Of Jeremy Piven)</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jeremy Piven was largely considered to be one of the nicest guys in Hollywood. Many people love him as Ari Gold on&nbsp;Entourage, or at least they did, at least until you hear what former guest star Ariane Bellamar had to say about it: "Jeremy Piven, on two occasions, cornered me & forcefully fondled my breasts & bum. Once at the [Playboy] mansion & once on set."</p><p>Bellamar then Tweeted at Piven, "‘Member when you cornered me in your trailer on the #Entourage set?”.</p><p>While the backlash caused Piven to be dropped from&nbsp;The Late Show, he did deny the claims, saying, "I unequivocally deny the appalling allegations being peddled about me. It did not happen."</p><h2 id=any-harvey-weinstein-film-and-his-81-oscars><strong>Any Harvey Weinstein&nbsp;Film (And His 81 Oscars)</strong></h2><p>By now we're sure you're well aware of the allegations thrown at former Hollywood producer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvey Weinstein</a>. Over 60 women have come out and stated various accounts of inappropriate behavior, including assault, harassment and moments of unwanted exposure on Weinstein's part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Weinstein has denied any non-consensual encounters, but something tells us that probably won't hold up in court.</p><p>Weinstein has won 81 Oscars. Here are some of his most notable ones: Pulp Fiction (as well as several other Tarantino films), The English Patient, Good Will Hunting, Shakespeare In Love, Chicago, and Silver Linings Playbook.</p><h2 id=the-pianist-because-of-roman-polanski><strong>The Pianist (Because Of Roman Polanski)</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roman Polanski</a> should never have received his standing ovation at the 2003 Academy Awards after he won the award for Best Director.</p><p>In 1977, Polanski was arrested after a 13-year-old girl, Samantha Gailey, accused Polanski of drugging and assaulting her. As well as this, Gailey stated that Polanski requested her to be topless for a photoshoot.</p><p>"We were alone and I didn’t know what else would happen if I made a scene. So I was just scared, and after giving some resistance, I figured well, I guess I’ll get to come home after this," said Gailey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Polanski ended up fleeing the United States to avoid punishment. Polanski has since tried to defend himself saying their&nbsp;intimacy was consensual.</p><h2 id=the-loud-house-because-of-chris-savino><strong>The Loud House (Because Of Chris Savino)</strong></h2><p>Chris Savino is best known for his creation of the animated series The Loud House which aired on Nickelodeon for 51 episodes. But 12 women, spanning the past few years, have accused Savino of inappropriate behavior including threatening their careers if they did not respond to his advances.</p><p>Chris Savino was fired from Nickelodeon and responded to the allegations on his Facebook page in October, "I am deeply sorry and I am ashamed. Although it was never my intention, I now understand that the impact of my actions and communications created an uncomfortable environment."</p><h2 id=the-gambler-because-of-james-toback><strong>The Gambler (Because Of James Toback)</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>James Toback has had a substantial career in Hollywood working as both a director and screenwriter. But as of now, over 200 women have come out and accused him of harassing them. Several notable names are included, such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel McAdams</a> who described a meeting in his hotel room: "Pretty quickly the conversation turned quite sexual and he said, 'You know, I just have to tell you. I have&nbsp;[pleasured myself] countless times today thinking about you since we met at your audition.”</p><p>The most notable and one of the more recent films from Toback may have been&nbsp;The Gambler, which was written by Toback. He had also previously written a version of the film in 1974 that starred James Caan.</p><h2 id=newsradio-because-of-andy-dick><strong>NewsRadio (Because Of Andy Dick)</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Dick</a> has had a long career in Hollywood, even if most of it hasn't been under the most favorable light. Dick's biggest claim to fame may be the show NewsRadio but he was about to appear in a new independent film titled Raising Buchanan.</p><p>That was until he got fired for allegedly groping people, unwanted kissing and licking the faces of upwards of 4 different people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When talking about the incident, Dick said,&nbsp;"I don't grope people anymore. I don't expose myself anymore....I might have kissed somebody on the cheek to say goodbye and then licked them. That's my thing — I licked Carrie Fisher at a roast. It's me being funny. I'm not trying to sexually harass people."</p><h2 id=power-rangers-wild-force-because-of-ricardo-medina-jr><strong>Power Rangers Wild Force (Because Of Ricardo Medina Jr.)</strong></h2><p>Ricardo Medina Jr. had what many people may consider to be one of the coolest acting gigs in Hollywood - appearing as the Red Wild Force Ranger - on Power Rangers Wild Force.</p><p>He also portrayed another character on Power Rangers Samurai. But in 2015 an argument between Medina and his roommate, Joshua Sutter, turned fatal after Medina stabbed him with what was reportedly a "Conan the Barbarian" type sword.</p><p>While he initially claimed self-defense, he was sentenced back in March 2017 to upwards of 6 years in prison. Something tells us with that charge on his resume though, that he won't be getting too many role offers to play good guys again. Perhaps he'll just focus on getting really buff in prison and try to re-make himself as a convict in a movie?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=house-of-cards-because-of-kevin-spacey><strong>House Of Cards (Because Of Kevin Spacey)</strong></h2><p>As we alluded to earlier, our list could have been all about Kevin Spacey films. And while we're only including two of his projects, it's still more of a mention than any other celebrity on our list.</p><p>Because sure, American Beauty is great but it's also over a decade old. Part of why the world feels so rocked by Spacey is that House of Cards was one of Netflix's flagship shows with over 30 Emmy Nominations.</p><p>The jury is still out on if the series is going to be canceled or just put on hiatus, but Spacey isn't coming back and watching him manipulate people on his rise to power will make you sick in hindsight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2ivLe1xKxkmqaUYsCpu9asZK2gkal6or7EZqmuoZ6asW6u2Gamn55dqLCzscSnZKybkaOxorjSaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-movies-and-shows-that-are-ruined-by-off-screen-scandals.html&text=15%20Movies%20And%20Shows%20That%20Are%20Ruined%20By%20Off-Screen%20Scandals&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-movies-and-shows-that-are-ruined-by-off-screen-scandals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-movies-and-shows-that-are-ruined-by-off-screen-scandals.html&title=15%20Movies%20And%20Shows%20That%20Are%20Ruined%20By%20Off-Screen%20Scandals" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-movies-and-shows-that-are-ruined-by-off-screen-scandals.html&title=15%20Movies%20And%20Shows%20That%20Are%20Ruined%20By%20Off-Screen%20Scandals" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-movies-and-shows-that-are-ruined-by-off-screen-scandals.html&title=15%20Movies%20And%20Shows%20That%20Are%20Ruined%20By%20Off-Screen%20Scandals" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-movies-and-shows-that-are-ruined-by-off-screen-scandals.html&description=15%20Movies%20And%20Shows%20That%20Are%20Ruined%20By%20Off-Screen%20Scandals" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-many-days-are-safe-after-periods-to-avoid-pregnancy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Many Days Are Safe After Periods To Avoid Pregnancy?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./deion-sanders-hoping-for-lucrative-watch-deal-for-sheduer-after-celebration-goes-viral.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              Deion Sanders Wants 'Lucrative Watch Deal' For Shedeur After Celebrat">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
