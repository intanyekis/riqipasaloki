He was accompanied by the two most important people in his life when he won. One of the ladies was his mother, and the other was his ex-girlfriend.</p><p>He said, holding his two lifelines close to him,</p><p>“This is the wealthiest I’ve ever been in my life.”</p><p>His mother, Anita, and his girlfriend were without a doubt the most important people in his life. When it comes to women in his life, Martins’ heart is as soft as a marshmallow.</p><p>His mother, Anita, is very special to him. On June 18, 2018, the Latvian-American arrived with his younger brother at his mother’s photo exhibit.</p><p>His mother snuggled her head to Martins’ shoulder as he delivered his grateful speech, and his then-girlfriend looked on proudly. The world’s strongest man in the video also addressed his then-girlfriend as “My Lady.”</p><p>But the relationship that seemed to last forever has now ended because his ex-girlfriend has moved on with her life.</p><p>“The Lady”: Who Is She?</p><p>He referred to her as his “Lady,” and she is the world’s third strongest woman. Rebecca Rowley, Martins’ ‘then-girlfriend,’ came in third place on the list of the World’s Strongest Women in 2019.</p><p>She, like Martins, is an athlete and powerlifter. While the two have never openly discussed their split, they have moved on from each other. Rebecca has prioritized her career while also caring for her family.</p><p>Rebecca is happily married to Lucas Tru and has two sons from a previous relationship. She and her husband met on June 6th, 2019, and their love has grown stronger since then.</p><p>She wrote a heartfelt message to her husband on June 6th, 2020, while sharing a photo of herself kissing him. The caption said:</p><p>“I’m so grateful for the strength, security, and growth you’ve given me.<br>Lucas Tru, I adore you.<br>Thank you for walking confidently into my life 12 months ago.”</p><p>After getting engaged in late May 2020, the couple married in early June 2021. While Rowley has begun a new chapter in her life with her own family, Martins has advanced in his career by focusing solely on his career.</p><h2>Riding the Ladder to Glory</h2><p>Martins Licis, 30, is well-known for his victory in the 2019 World’s Strongest Man competition as well as the Arnold Strongman Classic. Licis began as a personal trainer in 2010 and advanced to compete in the Strength Classic in 2015. Licis, who stands at 1.9m, gradually became involved in the competitive powerlifting world after winning the Odd Haugen All-American Strength Classic.</p><p>His journey to World Strongest Man was not without difficulty. The 30-year-old first entered the competition in 2016 after being chosen for the finals. He did, however, place six.</p><p>He tried again in 2017 and 2018 but only came in fourth place. Martins entered another competition to win, and this time he came in first place in June 2019.</p><p>He also competed in the Arnold Strongman Classic, finishing second that year. But, when he won the title in 2020, he quickly made it his own.</p><p>Since then, he has appeared on numerous shows such as Game on!, To Tell the Truth, and in a Geico commercial.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Smolsprout</a>, <a href=#>Martin Braithwaite</a>, and <a href=#>Victoria Mercado</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Personal Trainer</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Professional Powerlifter</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Dave Rienzi- Bio, Wiki, Height, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>Dave Rienzi, a personal trainer most known for his work with actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, was born in the United States of America on April 25, 1984.
