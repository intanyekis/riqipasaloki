Her mother’s name is Esther Peluso, but her father’s identity is not known. She has not revealed any information about her siblings, if she has any.

In March 1998, she started a magazine called Vent, which targeted young people.&nbsp;However, the magazine failed later that year.</p><p>She played a pivotal role in shaping Limbaugh’s career during their marriage and continued to work in the media industry after their divorce.&nbsp;She also became involved in Rush’s show and helped him with research, writing, and editing. She also appeared on his show occasionally, as a guest or a co-host.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Rise and Fall of Marta and Rush: A Love Story That Ended Too Soon</h2><p>Marta Fitzgerald and Rush Limbaugh were once a power couple in the American media and politics. They met online, fell in love, got married, and lived a lavish lifestyle. But their marriage was not meant to last, and they divorced after 10 years of being together. What happened to their relationship? How did they move on with their lives? Here is a summary of their love story, from their first encounter to their final separation.</p><p><strong>How They Met</strong></p><p>Marta Fitzgerald was a former aerobics instructor and a journalism graduate from the University of North Florida. She was also a fan of Rush Limbaugh.&nbsp;In 1990, she sent him an email through CompuServe, an online service provider, expressing her admiration for his work. Rush was intrigued by her message and replied to her.&nbsp;They started an online correspondence that soon turned into a phone romance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rush-Limbaugh-and-wife-Martha-Fitzgerald.jpg><p>At that time, Marta was still married to her first husband, Tom, with whom she had two children.&nbsp;Rush Limbaugh also divorced his second wife, Michelle Sixta, a college usherette, in 1990 after seven years of marriage. They had no children together.</p><p><strong>How They Got Married</strong></p><p>Marta and Rush dated for four years, keeping their relationship mostly private and away from the media spotlight. They finally decided to tie the knot on May 27, 1994, in a lavish and secretive ceremony.&nbsp;They got married at the United States Supreme Court, with Justice Clarence Thomas officiating the wedding.&nbsp;The wedding was attended by only a few close friends and family members and was kept a secret from the public until the next day.</p><p>Marta Fitzgerald and Rush Limbaugh’s residence was in Palm Beach, Florida.&nbsp;They bought a property on North Ocean Boulevard in 1998 for $3.9 million.&nbsp;The property consisted of three homes, with a total of 24,000 square feet of living space, and had beach access.&nbsp;They also had a radio studio in Palm Beach, where Limbaugh broadcasted his show.</p><p><strong>How They Divorced</strong></p><p>Marta and Rush seemed to have a happy and successful marriage. They lived a luxurious lifestyle, traveling around the world, attending social events, and hosting parties for their friends and guests. But behind the scenes, they were facing some challenges and difficulties. Rush was struggling with his addiction to painkillers, which he started taking after a spinal surgery that caused him chronic back pain. He also faced legal troubles, as he was accused of illegally obtaining and using prescription drugs. He admitted his addiction in 2003 and entered a rehabilitation program. Marta was supportive of her husband’s recovery. However, they decided to end their marriage in 2004, after 10 years of being together. The cause of the divorce is not clearly stated. However, some sources suggest that they had frequent arguments and grew apart over time.&nbsp;They announced their divorce in a joint statement, saying that they had “mutually and amicably” agreed to part ways. They did not have any children together, and they did not disclose the details of their divorce settlement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rush-Limbaugh-Wife-Marta.jpg><p><strong>How They Moved On</strong></p><p>Marta and Rush moved on with their lives after their divorce, but they remained cordial and respectful of each other. Marta stayed out of the public eye and focused on raising her two children from her first marriage. Rush, on the other hand, continued his career as a radio host, television personality, and political commentator. He also found love again, and married his fourth wife, <a href=#>Kathryn Adams</a>, a former events planner, in 2010. They had a lavish wedding at the Breakers Resort in Palm Beach, with guests such as Sean Hannity, Karl Rove, and Tom Watson. They lived in Rush’s mansion in Florida and traveled around the world. Rush also became more involved in politics and supported Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016 and 2020.</p><p>Rush died on February 17, 2021, at the age of 70, after a long battle with lung cancer. He was mourned by his fans, friends, family, and colleagues. He was also honored by President Trump, who awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2020. Marta did not comment on Rush’s death, but she reportedly sent her condolences to his widow, Kathryn. She also inherited some of Rush’s estate, as he had left her a trust fund in his will.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Marta Fitzgerald and Rush Limbaugh had a love story that started online, blossomed into a marriage, and ended in a divorce. They had their ups and downs, their joys and sorrows, their successes and failures. They shared a decade of their lives, but they also went their separate ways. They were once a power couple, but they were also human beings. They were Marta and Rush, and this was their story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGikmqqklnqntdOznp6qkaGxbr7UrJ9mpJmir6LBxqFm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmarta-fitzgerald-rush-limbaugh.html&text=Rush%20Limbaugh%27s%20Wife%20Marta%20Fitzgerald-%20Inside%20her%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Marriage%20with%20Conservative%20Commentator.&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarta-fitzgerald-rush-limbaugh.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarta-fitzgerald-rush-limbaugh.html&title=Rush%20Limbaugh%27s%20Wife%20Marta%20Fitzgerald-%20Inside%20her%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Marriage%20with%20Conservative%20Commentator." target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmarta-fitzgerald-rush-limbaugh.html&title=Rush%20Limbaugh%27s%20Wife%20Marta%20Fitzgerald-%20Inside%20her%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Marriage%20with%20Conservative%20Commentator." target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmarta-fitzgerald-rush-limbaugh.html&title=Rush%20Limbaugh%27s%20Wife%20Marta%20Fitzgerald-%20Inside%20her%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Marriage%20with%20Conservative%20Commentator." target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarta-fitzgerald-rush-limbaugh.html&description=Rush%20Limbaugh%27s%20Wife%20Marta%20Fitzgerald-%20Inside%20her%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Marriage%20with%20Conservative%20Commentator." target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./scott-hastings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Scott Hastings Net Worth, Age, Height, Wife, Family, Wiki 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jeri-ryan-on-joining-star-trek-picard-resistance-was-futile.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeri Ryan on 'Star Trek: Picard' role: 'Resistance was futile'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
