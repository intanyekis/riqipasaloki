The "Tiny Dancer" singer has lived one of the most exciting lives, with moments of it highlighted in his film biography Rocketman. He's also become friends with many people in not just the music industry but across all entertainment and even politics!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From friendships that just click to helping icons through addiction, here are some of Elton John's most iconic friendships.</p><h2 id=princess-diana><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Princess Diana</span></h2><p>It seems everyone loved the Princess of Wales, including Elton John. He first met England's Rose after performing for Prince Andrew's twenty-first birthday party, and instantly warmed to her presence. They continued their friendship through public appearances like Live Aid and were there for each other through difficult times.</p><p>Weeks before the world would lose Diana, they both attended the funeral of another mutual friend, Gianni Versace, not knowing what dark future awaited. Elton went on to perform a tribute for her at her funeral six weeks later, with re-written words of his song "Candle In The Wind".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Royals Didn't Want Elton John Singing At Princess Diana's Funeral, New Documents Reveal</a></span></p><h2 id=freddie-mercury><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Freddie Mercury</span></h2><p>It seems almost fate to see two of rock's legendary performers become friends - making Freddie Mercury and Elton John one of the world's best pairings. Freddie Mercury struck up a friendship with Princess Diana as well and one night even sneaked her out and dressed her up in drag to go to a gay club. In terms of Elton John, their friendship included drag queen alter egos and plenty of gifts, but the most poignant moments seem to come from tragedy once again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before losing another friend to AIDS, Elton would visit Freddie Mercury constantly during his sickness to not only visit a friend but to pay back the kindness given to others so frequently by Freddie. One of Freddie's last actions was to send a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas present to Elton</a>, which he received after Freddie's passing.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lady Gaga</span></h2><p>Another match made in musical heaven, the friendship between Lady Gaga and Elton John has lasted over a decade. They first met while performing together at the 2010 Grammy Awards and have loved each other ever since. Just one year later when Elton and his husband David Furnish's first son was born, they asked Gaga to be his <a href=#>godmother</a>, and then asked her again in 2013 after their second son was born. They've continued to perform together and even released a song together titled "Sine From Above" on Gaga's latest album Chromatica.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Elton John And Husband, David Furnish Are Raising Their Kids</a></span></p><h2 id=neil-patrick-harris><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Neil Patrick Harris</span></h2><p>One of Elton John's favorite people to vacation with, Neil Patrick Harris and his family often spend time with Elton and his family - whether it's on a vacation somewhere sunny or attending one of Elton's shows.</p><p>They first truly met at the 2009 Tony Awards when Neil hosted the award show and Elton was there to perform and represent his musical Billy Elliot. From then on they hit it off and Elton even performed at his wedding to David Burtka.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ozzy-osbourne><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ozzy Osbourne</span></h2><p>Elton John will befriend anyone with a good heart, and he's been friends with the Osbournes for decades. It may seem like a bizarre pairing, but the love between these two friends is there, with Elton frequently praising Ozzy and showering him with gifts like he did in an episode of The Osbournes.</p><p>Though they famously never partied together, they have collaborated on the titular song "Ordinary Man" from Ozzy's 2020 album Ordinary Man. The beautiful song encapsulates both legendary performers, as they struggle with fame but can't resist it either.</p><h2 id=eminem><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Eminem</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the first people he famously helped get sober, Eminem and Elton John's relationship may have appeared rocky to many viewers, but it is one of the <a href=#>most genuine</a>. Their friendship started back at their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2001 Grammy Awards performance</a> they when Eminem wanted to make a statement that he didn't stand for homophobia and was welcomed by one of the most iconic gay men in history. While Eminem knew little about Elton before meeting, they had an instant connection and Elton was able to be there for Eminem in a way no one else had.</p><p>After undergoing similar struggles with drugs, Elton decided he wanted to help Eminem overcome his addiction and gave him much-needed advice when asked for it. Eminem has even gone on to state Elton has saved his life, making their bond inseparable. Even years later they continue to both compliment and congratulate each other.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Celebs Elton John Is Surprisingly Close To</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-beckhams><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Beckhams</span></h2><p>Besides music, Elton has had a lifetime passion for soccer and was even a chairman of the Watford Football Club (which he continues to support when he can). It seems then that a relationship between one of the best soccer players in history, David Beckham, and his family is only natural, with Victoria Beckham becoming one of his closest friends. Victoria even claims Elton was the reason she decided to leave the Spice Girls, after deciding she no longer wanted to go down that path.</p><p>Like Neil Patrick Harris and his family, the Beckhams also frequently vacation with Elton and his family. And, while it may have angered David Beckham's family, Elton and his husband were even named godparents alongside Elizabeth Hurley to the Beckham boys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rod-stewart><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Rod Stewart</span></h2><p>While these two would like people to think they despise each other, with their constant pranks and teasing of one another, they are great friends. Their story started over fifty years ago, meeting before Elton even became the superstar he is now. Over their many years, their pranks and spats have included Rod Stewart changing words to one of Elton's songs, Elton shooting down one of Rod's blimps, Rod removing one of Elton's concert banners, and Elton competing for attention with cheeky billboards. Like with Mercury, the pair also have drag names for each other - Sharon (Elton) and Phyllis (Rod) respectively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though they still love each other, as much as they continue to fight, Elton had no hesitations in writing an entire chapter in his autobiography Me about how much he can't stand Rod Stewart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqoqpdmrm1u81moaignmK2pLvNoppmnqKesq%2Bw0qGgqatf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsir-elton-john-iconic-friendships.html&text=Elton%20John%27s%20Most%20Iconic%20Friendships&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsir-elton-john-iconic-friendships.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsir-elton-john-iconic-friendships.html&title=Elton%20John%27s%20Most%20Iconic%20Friendships" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsir-elton-john-iconic-friendships.html&title=Elton%20John%27s%20Most%20Iconic%20Friendships" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsir-elton-john-iconic-friendships.html&title=Elton%20John%27s%20Most%20Iconic%20Friendships" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsir-elton-john-iconic-friendships.html&description=Elton%20John%27s%20Most%20Iconic%20Friendships" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-cremated.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Does It Cost to Get Cremated?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1301887-comcast-ending-peacock-premium-promotion-for-xfinity-customers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Comcast Ending Peacock Premium Promotion For Xfinity Customers">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
