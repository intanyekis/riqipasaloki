Swift complimented his single "Better Now."</p><p>On April 18th, 2024, Swift shared on her Instagram account that <strong>"Fortnight" is the first single from the album</strong>. She complimented Post Malone once again and wrote in her caption:</p><p>“I’ve been such a huge fan of Post because of the writer he is, his musical experimentation and those melodies he creates that just stick in your head forever.
