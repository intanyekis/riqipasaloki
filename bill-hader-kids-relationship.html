People might not hear from famous dads quite as often but there are so many of them who are doing an amazing job raising their kids, from John Legend to Channing Tatum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bill Hader is known for starring on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live, particularly as the famous character "Stefan," and he has also acted in several movies. He played the main character in the dark HBO comedy&nbsp;Barry&nbsp;and people were also interested when he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">used to date Rachel Bilson</a>. Some fans might not even know that he has kids as the focus is often on his comedy, but he has three daughters with his ex-wife, Maggie Carey.</p><p>What is Bill Hader's relationship like with his kids? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=a-tough-time>A Tough Time</h2><p>Every day, it seems like there are articles airing celebrities' dirty laundry, but sometimes, the stars themselves will admit when they've been having a difficult time.</p><p>In July 2020,&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;reported that Bill Hader and Rachel Bilson had broken up, which is sad news since&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple seemed totally in love.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The previous summer, Bill Hader went through a rough period, proving that his relationship with his children hasn't always been 100&nbsp;percent perfect or all rainbows and butterflies, and he has been open about it.</p><p>In the summer of 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hader said he was with his kids for five days</a>. According to&nbsp;People, he was shooting&nbsp;It: Chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;along with working on the scripts for season two of&nbsp;Barry.</p><p>Hader said,&nbsp;“I think I saw my kids a total of five days all summer. It was terrible." He continued, "I’m going, ‘Next summer I’m taking off. And I’m going to spend every day with them.' It’s this weird thing where when you’re in this industry, you don’t have time to be with them, and it’s really, really difficult. I’m getting emotional right now talking about it." He really did cry in the interview and joked that he had never done that before.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Pete Davidson’s Time On SNL</a></span></p><h2 id=hader-s-family-life>Hader's Family Life</h2><p>Hader and Carey's daughters are named Hayley (six years old), Harper (eight years old), and Hannah (who is 11).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the way that the actor talks about his kids, and the fact that he teared up while talking about not seeing them enough one summer, it's clear that he loves them so much.</p><p>Hader once shared a cute story about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannah learning about the tooth fairy</a>. According to&nbsp;The Huffington Post, he said that he filmed his daughter's reaction to losing a tooth and&nbsp;hearing about the tooth fairy. He said to her, "Hey, Hannah, the tooth fairy came, oh, my gosh."</p><p>As it turned out, his younger daughter, Harper, got really upset. She asked, "Someone was in our house?" and he said it was the tooth fairy. She said, "Someone was in my room? While I was sleeping? And you guys are cool with this?" This is so funny to hear about, since a lot of the time, kids simply accept that there's a tooth fairy and they like getting the money for losing a tooth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;The Huffington Post, Hader also said that a famous actor told him that he stars on his own TV show, that'll enable him to be home more and see his children more often. He said that when he's away working, he keeps in touch with his kids over FaceTime but it's definitely not the same thing. He said, "You’d rather just be there, though. Any actor has to deal with this stuff."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About David Bowie’s Daughter’s Name: Alexandria Zahra Jones</a></span></p><p>Bustle&nbsp;reported that Carey and Hader have legal and joint custody of their kids, so it definitely sounds like when he's not working, he seems them as much as he can.</p><p>Even though he might feel badly about having to work so much, it sounds like Hader's girls love what he does. According to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet, when he was filming It Chapter 2, they asked if he could put Pennywise on FaceTime so they could see and talk to the scary clown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hader said that, of course, he was worried that&nbsp;It&nbsp;would be too intense for his little ones, so he had them watch&nbsp;The Sandlot. But he knew they could tell it wasn't the same movie since Pennywise the clown was nowhere to be seen.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian Is Done: A Full Timeline Of Her Relationship With Kanye West</a></span></p><p>While it's sad that Bill Hader only saw his children for five days one summer, he seems like a wonderful father who cares about them and is doing his best juggling work and family.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Fresh Prince’s’ Alfonso Ribeiro Posts Adorable Video Of His Daughter’s Dental Hygiene</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZoqScYrWisMSrZKShlKh6s7HLmquip56otaq8jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbill-hader-kids-relationship.html&text=The%20Truth%20About%20Bill%20Hader%27s%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Kids&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbill-hader-kids-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbill-hader-kids-relationship.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Bill%20Hader%27s%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbill-hader-kids-relationship.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Bill%20Hader%27s%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbill-hader-kids-relationship.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Bill%20Hader%27s%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbill-hader-kids-relationship.html&description=The%20Truth%20About%20Bill%20Hader%27s%20Relationship%20With%20His%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./zach-muckleroy-ceo-of-muckleroy-falls-dies-in-car-crash.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zach Muckleroy, CEO of Muckleroy &amp;amp; Falls, dies in car crash">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./actress-anita-briem-from-the-tudors-bio-measurements-net-worth-dylan-dog-wedding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Measurements, Net Worth, Dylan Dog, Wedding The Talks Today">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
