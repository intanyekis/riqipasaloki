In an interview with Deadline, Saldana expressed her gratitude, "I feel fortunate and incredibly lucky to have been part of films with exceptional directors and talented casts."

The actress has encountered personal struggles with disorders that she regarded as potentially life-threatening.</p><h2 id=zoe-saldana-shared-her-struggles-with-adhd-and-dyslexia>Zoe Saldana Shared Her Struggles With ADHD And Dyslexia</h2><p>Zoe Saldana shared her journey with ADHD and dyslexia in a video released by the Child Mind Institute during their #MyYoungerSelf campaign back in 2018. In the clip, Saldana emphasized the importance of speaking up when facing challenges and seeking support from trusted individuals. Her message was centered around self-acceptance and the belief that one's experiences are valid and deserving of attention.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/zoe-saldana-got-cast-in-the-netflix-series-scratch-thanks-to-a-major-hollywood-a-lister.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Discussing the challenges she faced in school due to ADHD and dyslexia, Saldana empathized with children dealing with similar difficulties during the pandemic, "Growing up with ADHD and dyslexia meant school was challenging." the actress said.</p><p>"I can't imagine how hard a year like we've just had would be for kids who face the same classroom struggles that I did. Adjusting to remote learning, trying to stay focused on a screen hour after hour."</p><p>In a 2011 interview with Latina, Saldana disclosed that the immense success of her blockbuster film Avatar in 2009 took a toll on her mental well-being. The subsequent year was emotionally overwhelming, as she found herself constantly traveling across different time zones. "... Your body gets exhausted, and by the end of the year I just collapsed," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zoe-saldana-suffers-from-a-hereditary-health-condition-called-hashimoto-39-s-thyroiditis>Zoe Saldana Suffers From A Hereditary Health Condition Called Hashimoto's Thyroiditis</h2><p>In an interview with The Edit, Zoe Saldana revealed that she struggles with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an autoimmune condition that affects the thyroid gland</a>. Despite her seemingly vibrant appearance, the star's health journey took an unexpected turn with this diagnosis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-8-1.jpg><p>Hashimoto's thyroiditis occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing inflammation, swelling, and gradual damage over time. This leads to decreased thyroid hormone production, resulting in symptoms such as fatigue, muscle pain, dry skin, and weight gain. Surprisingly, the actress is not the only one in her family affected by this condition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Saldana's mother and sisters have battled Hashimoto's, and it seems that the actress herself started experiencing signs of an overactive thyroid, at the age of 17. "My mother struggled with Hashimoto's early on in her life--fighting fatigue, wanting to live a more active life, constantly feeling like her body was inflamed, and we were already showing markers for it from blood work we had done as teenagers. At 17, I showed signs of an overactive thyroid."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Say This Is Why Zoe Saldana Changed Her Name</a></span></p><p>During the interview, Saldana mentioned that despite her mother and grandmother being affected by the genetic condition, she initially thought that she was immune to the disease. "I had a great time in my twenties. Then your doctor says you're losing calcium in your bones."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I had normal anxiety. I was just super-curious about life, eager to conquer the world. I never felt unhappy or felt heart problems. I was always on the slender side. Then, talking to doctors, I learned how the thyroid can burn out quickly from over-activity. That was my case. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's in my 30s." Saldana recalled.</p><p>Fortunately, the actress recognized the symptoms, which typically emerge between the ages of 30 and 50. Detecting Hashimoto's can be a gradual process, spanning months or even years, due to its slow progression. This awareness allowed her to seek appropriate medical attention and take steps toward managing her condition effectively.</p><h2 id=how-did-zoe-saldana-manage-her-hashimoto-39-s-thyroiditis>How Did Zoe Saldana Manage Her Hashimoto's Thyroiditis?</h2><p>Zoe Saldana has adopted a proactive approach to managing her condition, primarily through maintaining a gluten-free and dairy-free lifestyle. Alongside her husband, Marco Perego, she made significant dietary changes, even though it presented a challenge for someone who appreciates food as much as she does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-10.jpg><p>Saldana's diagnosis prompted her to prioritize her health and well-being. "I learned the importance of a healthy diet and exercise, to avoid certain foods, and to make sure not to be deficient in selenium and vitamin D to assist my body, so it doesn't feel like it has to fight."</p><p>Although Hashimoto's cannot be cured, the onset of hypothyroidism can be managed through thyroid replacement therapy, which helps restore normal metabolism. In addition to medication, Saldana's treatment regimen includes dietary supplements such as vitamin D and selenium. She has embraced a revamped diet consisting of fresh fruits, vegetables, and unprocessed foods, an approach advocated by her nutritionist friend Alejandro Junger. "If your diet is consistently healthy, your body will have your back." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Saldana said.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-zoe-saldana-manage-her-adhd-and-dyslexia>How Did Zoe Saldana Manage Her ADHD And Dyslexia?</h2><p>Zoe Saldana attributes her ability to overcome ADHD to her involvement in ballet during her childhood. Saldana's mother made the intuitive decision to enroll her in ballet classes as an alternative to medications recommended by her doctors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-9.jpg><p>"Had my mom not had the intuitive wisdom to put me in ballet I think she would have eventually opted to concede to the medication the doctors were suggesting… I was suffering. I couldn't hold a thought. But there was something about the piano, the barre, your breath … and I became the most quiet, just f****** lethal little machine with ballet.” she told InStyle Magazine. "Then for the next ten years, I was dancing. It gave me so much peace, it centered me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>James Gunn Reveals Zoe Saldana Did Her Own Stunts In ‘Guardians Of The Galaxy’</a></span></p><p>Following the birth of her twins, Cy and Bowie, in 2014, Saldana also incorporated yoga into her fitness routine. Alongside yoga, Saldana has sought balance in her life, recognizing the importance of taking time for herself. "I just stay at home and do absolutely nothing. When I was younger, that would've made me feel like such a failure.
