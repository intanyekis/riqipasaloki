Rosa Martinez reportedly filed the bombshell lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court.</p><p>Rosa stated she is suing her former employers for assault and battery, , , retaliation, and wrongful termination. Court documents noted the housekeeper brought the lawsuit to vindicate her rights "against a powerful Hollywood couple and to put an end to their abusive practices towards domestic workers."</p><p><strong>ALSO READ</strong></p><h2 class=split>'Cruel and sadistic forms of sexual harassment'</h2><p>In the lawsuit, obtained by , Rosa accused Rochelle of subjecting her to “cruel and sadistic forms of sexual harassment and sexual assault that was unwelcome and persuasive, which escalated in their frequency and severity in retaliation for her complaints of unpaid overtime and abuse.” She said she started working as a live-in housekeeper for Rochelle and Irving in January 2022, taking care of cleaning their house, recording housekeeping expenses, setting the table and serving food, looking after their dogs, running various errands, as well as assisting Rochelle in her day to day tasks. Rosa claimed she worked “far more than the eight-hour workday that she had agreed" and complained to the couple in April about not being paid overtime. This allegedly caused Rochelle to retaliate with “cruel and intimidating behavior, often sexual in nature, in order to humiliate and degrade” the housekeeper “and force her into submissive obedience.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/3526a4c0-c154-45ac-a925-c5f57a21d588.931712380><p>Rosa accused Rochelle of “routinely” spanking her “buttocks with an open palm” and “violently pinched” her cheeks, often “causing her eyes to tear.” The suit continued, “On at least one occasion, Rochelle Azoff pinched” Martinez's “cheek while warning her not to complain about unpaid wages on behalf of herself and the other housekeepers." Furthermore, Rosa claimed Rochelle "summoned" her on multiple occasions and “completely undressed herself in front” of her “for no apparent reason other than to ask” the housekeeper “to compliment her body.”</p><p>According to the suit, Rosa "felt humiliated and powerless every time Ms Azoff forced her to look at her naked body and offer compliments but felt powerless to disobey.” She said Rochelle forced her to clean her “sex toys without protective gloves because she claimed to be allergic to rubber.” What's more? The embattled help said Rochelle even made her smell her nightwear “in order to determine whether to wash them, even though they were soiled with bodily fluids and other stains.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/b40344db-fa10-4bb2-9ad2-a651a9e1201c.1180475390><h2 class=split>Brought back past memories of rape</h2><p>Rosa detailed another incident including an alleged unwanted kiss on a private plane. The housekeeper described one incident in April 2022 in which Rochelle sexually assaulted her at a home during the Coachella Valley Music Festival. Rosa said she finally mustered the courage to tell her then-mistress to stop touching her as it brought back past memories of a sexual assault. However, Rochelle allegedly laughed at her. “In response, Rochelle Azoff chastised [Martinez] for being too sensitive, point [sic] out that if she had been through the pain of rape, she would be strong enough to endure her behavior,” the suit stated. Another occasion detailed in the suit saw Rochelle call Rosa into her bedroom where she was smoking a cigarette. The latter claimed Rochelle took her cigarette and burned it on top of her long sleeve blouse, and that "the ash went through [Martinez’s] blouse and burned her skin."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/c07912b9-772d-40ff-b29a-bbfc63344194.181284150><h2 class=split>Severance agreement</h2><p>Rosa recalled writing a letter of resignation in June 2022 and leaving the note on Rochelle's bed. In response, Rochelle allegedly threatened to have her strip searched unless she signed a severance agreement. Rosa said she signed the document in order to avoid having her body touched. She later learned that Rochelle had denigrated her to the agency she was hired from, telling them she had fired her and there was no resignation. Finally, the suit also named Irving as a defendant because, as Rosa alleged, he had knowledge that his wife had sexually battered the housekeeper and refused to take any corrective action. Rosa Martinez is seeking unspecified damages, per Radar Online.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooaKrtq%2BzjJqxqJ6WqHq4tcWeZKydqKqurbjYZpibraOasW65wKKbZqWRmbJutMSrZJyklZa7bq3DrqOtZaSkxrR5wJ%2BrnqpdrK6osYycpqaonJa2r8CMrJiyq12owqrA</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2firving-azoffs-wife-sexually-abused-maid-made-her-clean-adult-toys-after-wage-complaint-says-suit.html&text=Irving%20Azoff%27s%20wife%20sexually%20abused%20maid%2c%20made%20her%20clean%20adult%20toys%20after%20wage%20complaint%2c%20claims%20sui&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2firving-azoffs-wife-sexually-abused-maid-made-her-clean-adult-toys-after-wage-complaint-says-suit.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2firving-azoffs-wife-sexually-abused-maid-made-her-clean-adult-toys-after-wage-complaint-says-suit.html&title=Irving%20Azoff%27s%20wife%20sexually%20abused%20maid%2c%20made%20her%20clean%20adult%20toys%20after%20wage%20complaint%2c%20claims%20sui" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2firving-azoffs-wife-sexually-abused-maid-made-her-clean-adult-toys-after-wage-complaint-says-suit.html&title=Irving%20Azoff%27s%20wife%20sexually%20abused%20maid%2c%20made%20her%20clean%20adult%20toys%20after%20wage%20complaint%2c%20claims%20sui" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2firving-azoffs-wife-sexually-abused-maid-made-her-clean-adult-toys-after-wage-complaint-says-suit.html&title=Irving%20Azoff%27s%20wife%20sexually%20abused%20maid%2c%20made%20her%20clean%20adult%20toys%20after%20wage%20complaint%2c%20claims%20sui" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2firving-azoffs-wife-sexually-abused-maid-made-her-clean-adult-toys-after-wage-complaint-says-suit.html&description=Irving%20Azoff%27s%20wife%20sexually%20abused%20maid%2c%20made%20her%20clean%20adult%20toys%20after%20wage%20complaint%2c%20claims%20sui" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jayma-mays-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jayma Mays  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gia-kim.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gia Kim">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
