That’s right, just letting it fly as if you were a baby wearing a diaper. And why not, they’re celebrities! They can do as they please. But accidents are one thing. What happens when things get serious? What happens when someone wants some “wet work” done? That’s right, we’re talking about the epic golden shower. What is a golden shower you may ask? Well, it’s when one person pees on another. It can be in a funny manner or a sexual manner. Yes, there are people who actually get off on being peed on. The warm stream may be a welcoming sight for some, but is highly unsatisfying for most.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, say you have been stung by a jellyfish. Just like when Chandler Bing had to pee on Monica’s foot (fans of Friends rejoice!). There are a few extreme circumstances where peeing on someone could be publically acceptable. But generally, urinating is meant for bathrooms (and walls and trees when no one is looking). And for some reason, it could be necessary to be peed on if it is your job (ala television shows or movies). Some actors believe in the methodology of acting so much they can never break character. It doesn’t matter how the pee got there, it just matters that it did while these celebrities were stars. These are 10 Celebrities Who Have Been Peed On.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-zac-efron-thanks-nicole-kidman><strong>10. Zac Efron – Thanks Nicole Kidman</strong></h2><p>There is a love for your work that takes you beyond the call of duty. In the movie The Paperboy,<a href=#> Zac Efron</a> teams up with <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a> and such an incident took place. Kidman plays a trashy Southern Belle in the film. The most talked about scene takes place with another notorious Chandler Bing moment (Friends reference #2 for those at home keeping score). Kidman, dressed in a bikini, squats and has to pee on Efron once he gets stung by a&nbsp;jellyfish. Kidman described the action as one of the most “raw” things she has ever done on camera. Efron said Kidman made a “man out of him” during the four weeks they filmed. We’re assuming he was talking about the acting and sex scenes and not the peeing scene.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-ricky-martin-pretty-much-anyone><strong>9. Ricky Martin – Pretty Much Anyone</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Ricky Martin</a> likes Living La Vida Loca almost as much as he likes the art of the golden shower. Ricky Martin has gone public with his enjoyment of the act known as the “Golden Shower.” He has professed his enjoyment of it with such vigor, we have to wonder how many men Martin has actually peed on (and vice versa). The sheer numbers aren’t clear, but what is clear is that Martin likes urine way too much. Not many people open up about peeing on others (we are sure there are some closet peers out there), but we are sure of one thing - Martin likes wet work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-drake-fan-peed-on-him><strong>8. Drake – Fan Peed On Him</strong></h2><p>When you go to a movie theater in support of a friend’s feature film, there are just some things you don’t expect to have happen. In 2010, <a href=#>Drake</a> showed up to support <a href=#>T.I.</a> and his movie. Drake was just chilling when T.I.’s drunk friend, Terrance Curtis Beasley (otherwise known as Cap) went running down the aisle and couldn’t resist letting loose. Beasley apparently whipped it out and started peeing all over the place as he raced up the movie theater aisle. Drake was hit with some substantial friendly fire by Beasley. Drake was speechless after the incident occurred.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-chelsea-handler-jason-biggs><strong>7. Chelsea Handler – Jason Biggs</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Chelsea Handler</a> is never shy to share her opinions. But when she sat down with <a href=#>Conan O’Brien</a> on Wednesday, October 15th, nobody was expecting her to reveal that <a href=#>Jason Biggs</a> peed on her face. Handler was on the side of a boat and had just jumped into the water. She was holding on to the side of the boat and looked back up and saw Biggs and his penis staring right at her. He was aiming and firing. Handler recalled, “I couldn’t swim away. I was trapped. I was in a urinary Bermuda Triangle.” Handler couldn’t stop laughing and “took one for the team.” One thing is for certain: Jason Biggs was definitely casted correctly in American Pie.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-kanye-west-north-west><strong>6. Kanye West – North West</strong></h2><p>This one was a public display but definitely innocent in nature. <a href=#>Kanye West</a> was on a Vogue shoot and lying on a couch. With his wife, <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, sitting behind him, Kanye and their daughter, North, were posing for a nice family photo. But instead of a beautiful picture, Kanye got a nice gift from his daughter - a bunch of pee. Kanye got peed on as they were conducting the shoot. It was definitely a difficult position to be in, lying on the couch, posing, covered in urine. But Kanye, like most parents, was a good sport about it.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-fergie-herself><strong>5. Fergie – Herself</strong></h2><p>It can be difficult as a performer. Often times, they need to drink large amounts of liquid to stay hydrated. When you have to go to the bathroom and you’re on stage, there is nowhere to go. <a href=#>Fergie</a> found that out the hard way in a 2005 performance with the Black Eyed Peas. Fergie couldn’t hold it and she just had to go, peeing her pants on stage. Unfortunately, things were magnified due to her Khaki pants which did not hide the accident well at all. The pee stains were all over herself as she sang on stage. The photos and the incident were quite embarrassing and we’re guessing Fergie hits the bathroom right before heading on stage these days.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-kris-jenner-bladder-control><strong>4. Kris Jenner –&nbsp;Bladder Control</strong></h2><p>Naturally, all the best things happen live on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. During Season 6 of the show, <a href=#>Kris</a> accidentally peed herself while the cameras were rolling. Kris was with her daughter, <a href=#>Khloe</a>, at the beach. Khloe thought it would be funny to drive off before Kris could get into the car. Kris ran after the car, laughing. Kris wet her pants running after the car. “I just wet my pants!” Kris yelled. Khloe stopped the car, laughing. “Mom, do you need diapers now?” Khloe joked with Kris.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-lea-michele-herself><strong>3. Lea Michele – Herself</strong></h2><p>What is it like to be a big fan of someone and finally get to meet them? Well, for some fans, the joy is just too much. This was the case for actress and singer <a href=#>Lea Michele</a>. Prior to performing for President <a href=#>Barack Obama</a> at his 2013 inauguration, Michele remembers peeing everywhere. Michele was nervous about her performance and had her friend, actor Jonathan Groff, come to calm her down. He started to make her laugh and instead of calming Michele down, she peed all over herself. When asked if Michele had to change her underwear, she admitted it was much worse than that. “Oh, we had to change the bed,” she joked.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-paris-hilton-peed-on-herself-in-a-cab><strong>2. Paris Hilton – Peed On Herself In A Cab</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Paris Hilton</a> was out partying (shocker) and had a few too many. The drunk heiress went into Harden Jamison’s taxi cab. The Hawaiian taxi cab driver said that Hilton was too drunk to even realize that she had peed all over herself in the back of his cab. The disgusted cab driver had to mop up the towel and mess. He also stated he could use the urine soiled towel as proof that it was in fact Hilton that peed in his cab. Hilton’s “people” tried to tone down the incident and hoped the story would slowly go away.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-hugh-jackman-peed-on-himself-on-purpose><strong>1. Hugh Jackman –&nbsp;Peed On Himself On Purpose</strong></h2><p>When you gotta go, you gotta go. Just as musicians are stuck, anchored on stage with no bathrooms in sight, so are actors in plays. This is the case with<a href=#> Hugh Jackman</a> who was onstage playing Gaston in Beauty and the Beast. While performing in front of a theater audience, Jackman had a major urge to go to the bathroom. With few choices, Jackman stayed in character and peed himself. Jackman blamed the incident on needing to hydrate more before performances. He used to get headaches for the physical role so he opted to overhydrate and that backfired.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sources</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=#>http://perezhilton.com</a>; <a href=#>dailymail.co.uk</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmpoXZiyrbHBq6CtoZWoeri0zmafmq6VYq%2Bmsc1mq6Kmm6GypXnOp2Y%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-have-been-tinkled-on.html&text=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Have%20Been%20Tinkled%20On&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebrities-who-have-been-tinkled-on.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-have-been-tinkled-on.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Have%20Been%20Tinkled%20On" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-have-been-tinkled-on.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Have%20Been%20Tinkled%20On" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-have-been-tinkled-on.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Have%20Been%20Tinkled%20On" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-have-been-tinkled-on.html&description=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Have%20Been%20Tinkled%20On" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./beebo-hands-free-bottle-feeding-shark-tank.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beebo Hands Free Bottle Feeding  Shark Tank Update">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./travis-kelce-reveals-name-wants-use-baby-taylor-swift.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Travis Kelce Reveals The Name He Wants To Use If He Has A Baby With Taylor Swift  ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
