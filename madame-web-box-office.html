Marvel and DC are doing a phenomenal job in this regard, producing billion-dollar movies one after another.</p><p>But that doesn't mean they aren't prone to the occasional failure — as they have made some mistakes in the past, with underperformers like Elektra, The Punisher, Generation X, and Inhuman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their "success conversion ratio" is perhaps better these days, and studios may have learned from past mistakes. But continuous missteps in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) are the sole reason for its looming downfall.</p><p>Sony was confident about Madame Web's success — <a href=#>much like they were confident about Morbius</a>. Although Morbius was produced on an estimated $83 million budget, it earned $167.5 million at the box office.</p><p>Not an incredible feat by any Hollywood measure, but at least fans liked it, and gave it a decent 71 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and a 5.2 rating on IMDb. Critics, however, lamented the movie's pacing, story structure, and ostensibly poor editing.</p><p>But to date, Madame Web has suffered from even less favorable numbers, with a 12 percent "critics score" and a 57 percent "audience score" on Rotten Tomatoes, and a humiliating 3.8 rating on IMDb.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, let's examine how Madame Web – and, specifically, the Sony Spider-Man Universe – reached its lowest point.</p><p>What is the real reason behind SSU's astounding failure, one that few seemed to expect?

Well … "</p><p>According to the Times, Madame Web backlash started well before it debuted, and a trailer released in November seemed to herald a chilly box office reception:</p><p>"'Madame Web' started functioning as an online punching bag pretty much the moment its trailer was released in November. A line of clunky exposition delivered in monotone by Ms. Johnson became a meme: 'He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died.' (The line did not end up in the movie.)"</p><p>Some are directing their ire at <a href=#>Dakota Johnson</a> and <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney</a>, predictably asserting that the cast's women are the reason Madame Web's box office failure — which is completely outlandish.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sydney-sweeney-net-worth-2024-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>ICYMI</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Sydney Sweeney's Net Worth: From Euphoria To A-List Sensation</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>She shines in diverse roles, including Sony's Madame Web. Sydney Sweeney has a net worth of $10 million and her films have grossed over $566 million.</span><p>One big reason for Madame Web's box office failure is far simpler: the film's writers changed the basic plot of Madame Web, who was already a well-established character in Marvel Comics and its associated universe.</p><p>Madame Web was an elderly, blind clairvoyant, but the movie's creators sought to give the character of Madame Web a new image.</p><p>The absence <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">of the first Spider-Woman, Jessica Drew</a>, also angered fans, because she was the character most associated with Spider-Man's female counterpart. In her stead, the studio introduced three new "Spider-Women."</p><p>A "wrong timeline" is another likely cause for the movie's plot complications; Madame Web is set 18 to 20 years before Spider-Man's appearance, so Madame Web ought to be around 50 years old.</p><p>Creators altered the concept of how Spider-Man became Spider-Man. Its "Spider-Women" were protected by Madame Web, their origin story is absent, and their characters were somewhat under-developed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A confusing and frail plot is yet another major reason Madame Web hasn't seen success. But audiences have flocked in droves to myriad movies with weaker plots than this, and those films achieved blockbuster status.</p><p>Of course, their dialogue and adaptation from the comic source material (picturization) mesmerized audiences. Meanwhile, the picturization for Madame Web was serviceable, but certainly not outstanding.</p><p>Moreover, Madame Web's dialogue was plain absurd. A prominent example of that occurs when Madame Web finally dons her superhero costume.</p><p>At the end of the film, the character says: "You know the best thing about the future? It hasn't happened yet" — which made little sense, and became a final moment of cringe before moviegoers left the theater.</p><p>One more Madame Web meme is circulating, regarding the film's writing:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The above-quoted New York Times article also made frequent mention of criticism of Madame Web's dialogue:</p><p>"The reviews [for Madame Web] were lousy, with critics calling the movie 'a genuine Chernobyl-level disaster' that is 'full of bad dialogue delivered badly.' The box office numbers were somehow worse, landing 'Madame Web' among the lowest ticket sales ever for a superhero movie."</p><p>Any other critiques are moot in contrast: Madame Web flopped because of its baffling plot, and nonsensical lines delivered at a crucial part of the film.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shocking-album-flops-of-great-singers.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Flops Happen</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>These Are The Best-Selling Musicians' Biggest Album Flops</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>It can't rain (money) all the time, as is the case with the best-selling musicians' biggest album flops.</span><h2 id=how-madame-web-might-harm-upcoming-sony-spider-man-universe-projects><strong>How Madame Web Might Harm Upcoming Sony Spider-Man Universe Projects</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/madame-web-worried.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One immediate problem is fairly obvious – moviegoers will not forget Madame Web anytime soon.</p><p>Two weeks after its release, fans are still making Madame Web memes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and heavily criticizing it</a>.</p><p>A negative image of Sony's Spider-Man franchise has been established — and to salvage it, Sony would have to follow with a much stronger entry.</p><p>Another problem is that their next anticipated release is Kraven The Hunter, a trailer for which was released in 2023. SSU delayed its release date from October 6th (of last year) to August 30th 2024.</p><p>Delayed releases are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">typically perceived as a signal of poor confidence</a> from the studio – and the order of release between the two films suggests Sony decided to drop Madame Web first, hinting that Kraven The Hunter was not strong enough to compete at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps they want to re-work Kraven The Hunter's script, for better or for worse. Time will tell, but Sony's expectations for Kraven the Hunter might be low, and this looks to be a worrisome situation for SSU.</p><p>Plus, Sony's Venom 3 is also slated for release in November of this year.</p><p>Venom has been their most successful project in the genre, as the first film bagged $856 million at the box office.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tom-hardy-movies-2024.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>More On The Venom Series</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>From Inception To Venom: The Highest-Grossing Tom Hardy Movies, Ranked</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Tom Hardy has appeared in more than 60 films to date.
