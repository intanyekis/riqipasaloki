His character was not unlike that of his current WWE incarnation, except that he was presented as an investor in the company and an on-screen authority figure.

In the early days of Impact Wrestling, he teamed up with the former Disco Inferno, Glenn Gilbertti, as The New York Connection, and made one-off appearances on One Night Only PPVs in the years since.</p><p>However, Swinger returned to Impact in 2019 with a new gimmick: that of a throwback comedy character whose mind is solidly stuck in the 1980s territory days.</p><h2 id=brian-myers><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Brian Myers</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Brian-Myers-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Formerly known as Curt Hawkins, Brian Myers first came to Impact Wrestling in 2015, and was pretty much rocking the same gimmick he had in WWE the year before, carrying a cane and everything. A return to WWE saw him find some success with friend/tag partner/podcast partner Zack Ryder, but a 2020 release brought Myers back to the Impact Zone.</p><p>Now Myers is a heel nicknamed, “The Most Professional Wrestler,” who seeks to jettison his old life -- so much that he’s feuding with Ryder, now going under his real name of Matt Cardona.</p><h2 id=christopher-daniels><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Christopher Daniels</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Christopher-Daniels.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christopher Daniels was such a staple of TNA/Impact since the very beginning until 2014, that some fans might not even know that he left the company at one point.
