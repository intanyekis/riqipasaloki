As soon as tickets were available on Ticketmaster, people ran into trouble getting seats. And before anyone knew it, prices were through the roof. People wondered if it was possible to spend less than $1,000 and if they would even be able to see their favorite singer at all. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift is expected to earn $500 million-$1.5 billion</a> from the tour, according to Forbes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For fans who have attended Taylor Swift's Eras tour, do they think that these over-the-top ticket prices were justified?

After all, the split was announced while the singer was already performing around the United States. And Swift has also been in the news for the wild ticket prices for her Eras tour. Just how much are some of these tickets?</p><p>According to Music In Minnesota, tickets were supposed to be in the range of $49 and $449. But once fans went onto Ticketmaster, they saw prices that were much higher. The website reported that bots began buying the tickets and then putting them on other websites such as StubHub. This accounts for some of the high prices that people are seeing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-swift-2.jpg><p>Buzzfeed reported that out of several Taylor Swift fans who attended concerts, the cheapest ticket price was $150. Considering that it's pretty standard to pay around $60 for some smaller venues, even $150 sounds like a lot.</p><p>Other fans shared with Buzzfeed that they purchased tickets for $1,500, $300, $1,000, and $800.

She wrote, “I’m not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked them, multiple times, if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could. It’s truly amazing that 2.4 million people got tickets, but it really pisses me off that a lot of them feel like they went through several bear attacks to get them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=do-fans-think-taylor-swift-39-s-eras-tour-is-good>Do Fans Think Taylor Swift's Eras Tour Is Good?</h2><p>Do fans regret paying so much money for Taylor Swift's Eras tour or do they think that the high price was worth it?</p><p>Many fans were happy with the concert experience and don't seem to mind that their bank accounts are a little poorer now.

They wrote in a Reddit thread, "I paid an eye watering $3500 something for 2 mid-section tickets for ATL night 1."

The fan continued on Reddit that they were happy with their decision. They wrote, "Was it worth it? To see Taylor definitely."</p><p>Redditor @eARThbendingYeti shared that they spent almost $400 and they thought that it was a great show. They wrote, "I paid $380 after fees and bought the ticket on Stub Hub a week before the Arlington concert. Armpit section to the stage, couldn't see the main stage at all, but I'd say it was worth it.
