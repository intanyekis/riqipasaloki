He grew up with his three sisters and was raised in a household where a Catholic faith is practiced. C.K. was only infant when his family decided to move to Mexico where his father eventually graduated from National Autonomous University of Mexico. His first language growing up was Spanish and it was not until he was seven years old when he finally learned English upon their return to the U.S. Since he was only seven years old at the time, he admitted to have forgotten the Spanish language when he grew up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>C.K. was only ten years old when his parents divorced.

Although he had interest in creating short films, he was way more interested in pursuing a career in stand-up comedy.</p><p>He had his first attempt at standup comedy at an open mic night in some comedy bar in 1985. He was given about five minutes at the time however he only had two minutes of material. He was embarrassed at his failure at the time and did not do standup comedy for the next two years as he was discouraged by his performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-stand-up-comedy-breakthrough>His Stand Up Comedy Breakthrough</h2><p>As the comedy scene in Boston grew, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">C.K. gradually achieved success in performing</a> alongside Lenny Clarke and Denis Leary.
